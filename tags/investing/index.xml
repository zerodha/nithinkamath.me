When we started Zerodha in 2010, &amp;ldquo;VC&amp;rdquo; was an exotic term, and there was barely any startup activity. The most popular VCs were dads, uncles and aunts.
Starting around 2010, we began seeing interest driven by India&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;opportunity size.&amp;rdquo; India&amp;rsquo;s population has done more to attract VC money than anything else ðŸ˜› &amp;ldquo;India has 120 crore people, and even if 1% buy X&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>Real stories from parents investing through Zerodha minor accounts.</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/real-stories-from-parents-investing-through-zerodha-minor-accounts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/real-stories-from-parents-investing-through-zerodha-minor-accounts/</guid><description>I can keep giving gyan about starting to invest early for your kids, but nothing beats hearing it from parents who are actually doing it. Here are some first-hand takes from people using a Zerodha minor account to invest for their children.

Deepak Shenoy was among the first people I spoke to about the idea of Zerodha. When we started, he agreed to lend his credibility by having his name on our website as an advisor. ðŸ˜¬
We&amp;rsquo;re happy to be backing him through Rainmatter, as Capitalmind continues its journey of now being an AMC.</description></item><item><title>Stanley Druckenmiller on position sizing</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/stanley-druckenmiller-on-position-sizing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/stanley-druckenmiller-on-position-sizing/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Druckenmiller: What I actually learned is that position sizing is probably 70 to 80 per cent of the equation.

What most investors don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that they&amp;rsquo;d get far better returns by focusing on maximizing their earning potential rather than obsessing over picking the &amp;ldquo;best stocks and funds.</description></item><item><title>Sport startups we're proud to support</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sport-startups-were-proud-to-support/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sport-startups-were-proud-to-support/</guid><description>One of the issues with fitness is that gyms and similar facilities feel boring for a lot of people. I&amp;rsquo;ve always said that a better way to stay fit is to play a sport you enjoy because it won&amp;rsquo;t feel like a chore. Sports are also more accessible for a lot of people.
With this in mind, we&amp;rsquo;ve supported many sports-focused startups that are trying to get more Indians to pick up a sport through Rainmatter.</description></item><item><title>SCRA rules clarified</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/scra-rules-clarified/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/scra-rules-clarified/</guid><description>Finally, after clarification of SCRA rules by Ministry of Finance and NSE, brokers can now invest their own funds without exchange approvals or restrictions.
This is huge for Rainmatter. We can now allocate more capital to support Indian startups directly from the brokerage entity.</description></item><item><title>Retail buying spree continues</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/retail-buying-spree-continues/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/retail-buying-spree-continues/</guid><description>One of the crazy things about the last five-odd years is that retail investors have consistently been net buyers of equities. Whether they&amp;rsquo;ll continue to buy the dip is anybody&amp;rsquo;s guess. ðŸ˜¬
By the way, if markets fall sharply, investors might stay out of the market for yearsâ€”just like they did after 2008.</description></item><item><title>Why ETFs are more popular than mutual funds in the U.S</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-etfs-are-more-popular-than-mutual-funds-in-the-u.s/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-etfs-are-more-popular-than-mutual-funds-in-the-u.s/</guid><description>Something I learned recently on why ETFs in the US are preferred over MFs. ðŸ˜¬
US mutual funds are pass-through vehiclesâ€”if they generate capital gains, these must be distributed to unit holders who pay the taxes on the gains which makes MFs less tax-efficient. ETFs avoid this through &amp;lsquo;in-kind&amp;rsquo; creation/redemption that washes away gains. This tax advantage is significant. This is one underrated reason for the popularity of index funds, especially ETFs in the US.</description></item><item><title>India's trading hubs</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indias-trading-hubs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indias-trading-hubs/</guid><description>Ahmedabad and Mumbai account for 80% of equity delivery trades. Let that sink in. Essentially, the real money is with Gujjus ðŸ˜¬
Btw, Gujarat accounts for just 8% of the total registered investors, and the share has been falling.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Money Mindful series</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-the-money-mindful-series/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-the-money-mindful-series/</guid><description>Despite all the interest in the stock market after COVID, there are still only 5 crore unique mutual fund investors. I&amp;rsquo;ve said this earlier as wellâ€”one of the biggest challenges for the Indian markets is the lack of an advisory ecosystem with just about 900 RIAs.
If you consider mutual fund distributors, there are about 2.7 lakh+ plus, but still not enough. For a broad comparison, there are over 27 lakh+ insurance agents.</description></item><item><title>New investor demographics in India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/new-investor-demographics-in-india/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/new-investor-demographics-in-india/</guid><description>For the longest time, most of the investors in the Indian markets were more or less from the major metro cities. But this has changed dramatically after COVID. The bulk of new investors are from North India, and we&amp;rsquo;ve kinda missed out on getting them to invest with us.
This was something interesting that came up when I was catching up withAshish Chauhan as he shared the NSE India coffee table book.</description></item><item><title>Zerodha's growing AUM and investor profits</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodhas-growing-aum-and-investor-profits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodhas-growing-aum-and-investor-profits/</guid><description>Equity investors at Zerodha have realized a profit of Rs 50,000 crores over the last 4+ years and are sitting on unrealized profits of Rs 1,00,000 crores on an AUM of Rs 4,50,000 crores.

So far, 6 non-profit organizations have raised money, and we are happy to have supported them.
There&amp;rsquo;s no online mechanism to donate to these organizations like we have for regular IPOs but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this will soon be possible. We will then make it possible for all @zerodhaonline customers to support social sector organizations working on important issues.</description></item><item><title>Using passive funds to build the core of your portfolio</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/using-passive-funds-to-build-the-core-of-your-portfolio/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/using-passive-funds-to-build-the-core-of-your-portfolio/</guid><description>I have a vested interest in saying this ðŸ˜¬ being part of @ZerodhaAMC, but it&amp;rsquo;s a no-brainer to use low-cost index funds for your core portfolio. You can complement that with other funds, but the core should be passive funds.
The data shows it&amp;rsquo;s getting increasingly harder for active funds to outperform their benchmarks.

In fact, 72% of Individual investors don&amp;rsquo;t have a nominee for their demat accounts and mutual fund folios. Even if investors do add nominees, they don&amp;rsquo;t tell their nominees.
Life is unpredictable, and anything can happen. It&amp;rsquo;s not a pleasant thought, but making sure life is as comfortable as possible for your loved ones in your absence is a key part of life.</description></item><item><title>Open a Zerodha account for your kids and invest together</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/open-a-zerodha-a-count-for-your-kids-and-invest-together/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/open-a-zerodha-a-count-for-your-kids-and-invest-together/</guid><description>You need to know how to manage your money to do well in life. The things you need to know to manage your money well apply to other aspects of life as well. One of the best ways to learn about money is to start early, because the things we learn when we&amp;rsquo;re young tend to stick with us for the rest of our lives. One thing that has been on our to-do list for a long time is to make it as easy for parents to invest for their kids as they teach them about money.</description></item><item><title>Introducing LIQUIDCASE, India's first ETF with a growth NAV</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-liquidcase-indias-first-etf-with-a-growth-nav/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-liquidcase-indias-first-etf-with-a-growth-nav/</guid><description>LIQUIDCASE, India&amp;rsquo;s first ETF with a growth NAV from ZerodhaAMC just listed today with the same symbol. When we were thinking about the product, we wanted to offer something simple where investors didn&amp;rsquo;t have to bother about dividends, taxes etc.
So, the way LIQUIDCASE works is simple: the returns in the ETF will be added to the NAV just like growth mutual funds, and there are no dividends. This makes it easier for you to track your returns, and there are no hassles with fractional units and figuring out your taxes.</description></item></channel></rss>
