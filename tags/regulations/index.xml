Regulations are like a double-edged sword. They can be a moat for the business, but at the same time, they can make your business model invalid overnight. Regulations are easier when explicit (SEBI) than implicit (RBI), but I guess it is because RBI has to regulate a wide variety of intermediaries.</description></item><item><title>SEBI's new rules for direct payout of securities</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-new-rules-for-direct-payout-of-securities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-new-rules-for-direct-payout-of-securities/</guid><description>While SEBI is tightening rules to make the markets safer on the one hand, it is also making things simple on the other.
Starting from October 14th, shares bought will be directly credited to the customer&amp;rsquo;s Demat account through net settlement. This significantly simplifies our DP process, which today involves receiving shares for the entire group of clients and then allocating them based on purchases made, i.e., gross settlement.
And this is much safer, too.</description></item><item><title>Crypto platforms flaunting rules</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/crypto-platforms-flaunting-rules/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/crypto-platforms-flaunting-rules/</guid><description>On one side, SEBI is working on restricting F&amp;amp;O, but on the other side, this crypto F&amp;amp;O ad is on the front page of ET.
By the way, all these platforms have taken the stance that the 1% TDS rule doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to crypto F&amp;amp;O. For regular crypto transactions, 1% of the transaction is deducted as TDS. Something for @nsitharaman and @FinMinIndia to check out.</description></item><item><title>On SEBI's proposed changes to simplify DP processes</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/on-sebis-proposed-changes-to-simplify-dp-processes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/on-sebis-proposed-changes-to-simplify-dp-processes/</guid><description>This consultation paper, if implemented, significantly simplifies the DP operations of stock brokers. Today, when a client buys stock, it gets credited to the broker pool account, and then the broker credits it to the customer. In the new way proposed, the shares will get directly credited to the customer&amp;rsquo;s demat.
Even without this regulation, we&amp;rsquo;re probably the safest financial market in terms of the security of customer assets, given that everything is in the customer&amp;rsquo;s own demat.</description></item><item><title>The nuisance of dark patterns</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-nuisance-of-dark-patterns/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-nuisance-of-dark-patterns/</guid><description>My phone like for many has become unusable because of the nuisance of unsolicited calls, SMS, and WhatsApp messages I didnâ€™t opt-in for. I waste at least 15 minutes a day marking emails as spam because, in many cases, the unsubscribe option is hidden. Then, there are the deceptive UI/UX patterns, which make things even worse. But there seems to be hope around the corner.
The Department of Consumer Affairs recently issued draft guidelines for the prevention and regulation of dark patterns.</description></item><item><title>Dark patterns in banking</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/dark-patterns-in-banking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/dark-patterns-in-banking/</guid><description>A colleague had to visit a bank branch offline to close a personal loan he took online. This branch was one of only 2 in Bangalore. It&amp;rsquo;s the same with many other banks. Making it hard to close an account is a dark pattern, and maybe there should be regulations on this.
By the way, SEBI mandates that all stockbrokers must provide a facility to close accounts online. Additionally, at Zerodha, we are maybe one of the few brokers to allow online transfer of stocks to demat accounts outside Zerodha.</description></item><item><title>Addressing tax evasion</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/addressing-tax-evasion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/addressing-tax-evasion/</guid><description>Govt has to do whatever to curb underreporting of income &amp;amp; tax evasion. Easier said than done, but maybe the better way is to deter people by increasing penalties &amp;amp; acting quickly on financial violations. Those that want to evade taxes or break rules will always find loopholes.</description></item></channel></rss>
