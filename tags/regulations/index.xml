I am as clueless as everybody else. ðŸ˜ƒ
Having said that, I would not be surprised if they were banned completely, and/or if there is some product suitability framework that makes it harder for people to trade F&amp;amp;O.
By the way, as I&amp;rsquo;ve said numerous times before, regulatory risk is by far the biggest risk for brokers like us.</description></item><item><title>NSE's new algo trading circular</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/nses-new-algo-trading-circular/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/nses-new-algo-trading-circular/</guid><description>NSE&amp;rsquo;s new retail algo trading circular is finally out. Here are the highlights:
For individual traders who code: You can now automate strategies up to 10 orders/second with just a static IP for your API key - no registration needed! Beyond that threshold, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to register with the exchange.
For algo vendors: You&amp;rsquo;ll need to register with exchanges to partner with brokers, but once registered, your users won&amp;rsquo;t need individual static IPs.</description></item><item><title>SEBI and RBI initiatives to address growing digital frauds</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebi-and-rbi-initiatives-to-address-growing-digital-frauds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebi-and-rbi-initiatives-to-address-growing-digital-frauds/</guid><description>The sheer number and variety of digital frauds is astounding. It&amp;rsquo;s fair to assume that things will only get much worse from here, thanks to AI. Both SEBI and RBI are trying to educate people and implement measures to combat these frauds.
SEBI has published a consultation paper proposing unique UPI IDs for brokers to ensure that investors transfer money only to SEBI-registered brokers and not to scammers using UPI IDs with broker names.</description></item><item><title>Understanding SEBI's latest Algo trading guidelines</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/understanding-sebis-latest-algo-trading-guidelines/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/understanding-sebis-latest-algo-trading-guidelines/</guid><description>The SEBI circular on API usage and algo trading is out. What you need to know:
If youâ€™re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.
If youâ€™re selling algos or strategies to other traders, youâ€™ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.</description></item><item><title>Regulations are like a double-edged sword</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/regulations-are-like-a-double-edged-sword/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/regulations-are-like-a-double-edged-sword/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a saying, &amp;ldquo;You live by the sword, you die by the sword.&amp;rdquo; For regulated business, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;you live by regulations and die by regulations.&amp;rdquo;
Regulations are like a double-edged sword. They can be a moat for the business, but at the same time, they can make your business model invalid overnight. Regulations are easier when explicit (SEBI) than implicit (RBI), but I guess it is because RBI has to regulate a wide variety of intermediaries.</description></item><item><title>SEBI's new rules for direct payout of securities</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-new-rules-for-direct-payout-of-securities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-new-rules-for-direct-payout-of-securities/</guid><description>While SEBI is tightening rules to make the markets safer on the one hand, it is also making things simple on the other.
Starting from October 14th, shares bought will be directly credited to the customer&amp;rsquo;s Demat account through net settlement. This significantly simplifies our DP process, which today involves receiving shares for the entire group of clients and then allocating them based on purchases made, i.e., gross settlement.
And this is much safer, too.</description></item><item><title>Crypto platforms flaunting rules</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/crypto-platforms-flaunting-rules/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/crypto-platforms-flaunting-rules/</guid><description>On one side, SEBI is working on restricting F&amp;amp;O, but on the other side, this crypto F&amp;amp;O ad is on the front page of ET.
By the way, all these platforms have taken the stance that the 1% TDS rule doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to crypto F&amp;amp;O. For regular crypto transactions, 1% of the transaction is deducted as TDS. Something for @nsitharaman and @FinMinIndia to check out.</description></item><item><title>On SEBI's proposed changes to simplify DP processes</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/on-sebis-proposed-changes-to-simplify-dp-processes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/on-sebis-proposed-changes-to-simplify-dp-processes/</guid><description>This consultation paper, if implemented, significantly simplifies the DP operations of stock brokers. Today, when a client buys stock, it gets credited to the broker pool account, and then the broker credits it to the customer. In the new way proposed, the shares will get directly credited to the customer&amp;rsquo;s demat.
Even without this regulation, we&amp;rsquo;re probably the safest financial market in terms of the security of customer assets, given that everything is in the customer&amp;rsquo;s own demat.</description></item><item><title>The nuisance of dark patterns</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-nuisance-of-dark-patterns/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-nuisance-of-dark-patterns/</guid><description>My phone like for many has become unusable because of the nuisance of unsolicited calls, SMS, and WhatsApp messages I didnâ€™t opt-in for. I waste at least 15 minutes a day marking emails as spam because, in many cases, the unsubscribe option is hidden. Then, there are the deceptive UI/UX patterns, which make things even worse. But there seems to be hope around the corner.
The Department of Consumer Affairs recently issued draft guidelines for the prevention and regulation of dark patterns.</description></item><item><title>Dark patterns in banking</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/dark-patterns-in-banking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/dark-patterns-in-banking/</guid><description>A colleague had to visit a bank branch offline to close a personal loan he took online. This branch was one of only 2 in Bangalore. It&amp;rsquo;s the same with many other banks. Making it hard to close an account is a dark pattern, and maybe there should be regulations on this.
By the way, SEBI mandates that all stockbrokers must provide a facility to close accounts online. Additionally, at Zerodha, we are maybe one of the few brokers to allow online transfer of stocks to demat accounts outside Zerodha.</description></item><item><title>Addressing tax evasion</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/addressing-tax-evasion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/addressing-tax-evasion/</guid><description>Govt has to do whatever to curb underreporting of income &amp;amp; tax evasion. Easier said than done, but maybe the better way is to deter people by increasing penalties &amp;amp; acting quickly on financial violations. Those that want to evade taxes or break rules will always find loopholes.</description></item></channel></rss>
