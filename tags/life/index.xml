I have been reading and listening to quite a bit of Charlie Munger over the last few days. Every time I go down this rabbit hole, I tend to discover more about myself and what I think Zerodha should be.

It hasn&amp;rsquo;t just helped me reduce stress and anxiety, but I think it has also improved my cognitive abilities. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m almost forced to make healthier lifestyle choices when playing a sport regularly.
Given the benefits of playing a sport, picking up one If you can is a no-brainer, especially for kids.</description></item><item><title>Age is just a number</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</guid><description>Turned 44 today at 14.3% body fat, the lowest I have been.

People are generally curious about successful &amp;amp; famous people, so it&amp;rsquo;s easier for celebs from movies, sports, etc., maybe even some businessmen ðŸ˜€, to build a social media presence quickly.
For everyone else, there is always an incentive to be loud, controversial or oversell because that&amp;rsquo;s what gets the attention. The exception to this is people who write and share high-quality things, but this is very hard.</description></item><item><title>Trading advice from Ramesh Damani</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-advice-from-ramesh-damani/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-advice-from-ramesh-damani/</guid><description>A Tradingqna user pointed to a video of Ramesh Damani where he says, Trading is always done by slip book &amp;amp; not chequebook &amp;amp; asked what it meant.

It started with a response to a part-time job offer on WhatsApp. The first few tasks were about leaving fake reviews for resorts &amp;amp; restaurants in random places like Peru. ~Rs 30k was transferred to the bank for the tasks completed. A Telegram group was created with others who claimed to do these tasks.
The next task for the group was to trade on a mock crypto platform, following a bunch of rules.</description></item><item><title>No amount of money can buy good health.

A few thoughts on how and why you should focus on your health.
In chasing money goals, it is easy to forget that all the money in the world canâ€™t buy good health.

The common thing among successful traders &amp;amp; entrepreneurs is to always think in terms of risk to reward. They take a tradeâ€”buy a stock or take a business betâ€”only if they&amp;rsquo;ve made peace with the worst possible outcome
