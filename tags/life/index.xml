I didn‚Äôt win. As Zerodha, we‚Äôre building only for India, with a single source of revenue.

Everything feels like a cut, copy, and paste with very small differences.
In contrast, India is more like a continent than a country. The diversity in terms of languages, food, culture, etc., between the 28 states and within each state is nuts.
Every time I think of this, I am amazed at how the country actually came together.</description></item><item><title>Impromptu AMRAP workout</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impromptu-amrap-workout/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impromptu-amrap-workout/</guid><description>Impromptu AMRAP workout when Sisters in Sweat were at work üòÄ 1 min x pushups.</description></item><item><title>Telemarketing these days</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/telemarketing-these-days/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/telemarketing-these-days/</guid><description>My phone has become unusable due to telemarketing and is always silent.

Dad passing away, poor sleep, exhaustion, dehydration, and overworking out ‚Äîany of these could be possible reasons.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from having a big droop in the face and not being able to read or write to having a slight droop but being able to read and write more. From being absent-minded to more present-minded. So, 3 to 6 months for full recovery.</description></item><item><title>Importance of having a steady relationship</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/importance-of-having-a-steady-relationship/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/importance-of-having-a-steady-relationship/</guid><description>Here is a counter-argument in an age of short-term relationships: A steady relationship is underrated. Not having a volatile personal life makes life better. It also improves the odds of doing well personally and professionally.
We humans are social creatures, and we are hardwired to seek partners. But I don‚Äôt think a perfect partner exists. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and relationships are about compromises. Having said that, sometimes people aren&amp;rsquo;t compatible, and in such cases, ending the relationship makes sense.</description></item><item><title>You'll be missed, Mr Munger</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/youll-be-missed-mr-munger/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/youll-be-missed-mr-munger/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;I had written this about Mr. Charlie Munger in last year&amp;rsquo;s business update.

I have been reading and listening to quite a bit of Charlie Munger over the last few days. Every time I go down this rabbit hole, I tend to discover more about myself and what I think Zerodha should be. If I had to summarise, I could use some of his quotes (link to full post in comments)</description></item><item><title>Benefits of playing a sport</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/benefits-of-playing-a-sport/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/benefits-of-playing-a-sport/</guid><description>The one thing that has helped me remain sane and deal with the volatility of life is playing a sport regularly. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t just helped me reduce stress and anxiety, but I think it has also improved my cognitive abilities. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m almost forced to make healthier lifestyle choices when playing a sport regularly.
Given the benefits of playing a sport, picking up one If you can is a no-brainer, especially for kids.</description></item><item><title>Age is just a number</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</guid><description>Turned 44 today at 14.3% body fat, the lowest I have been.

People are generally curious about successful &amp;amp; famous people, so it&amp;rsquo;s easier for celebs from movies, sports, etc., maybe even some businessmen üòÄ, to build a social media presence quickly.
For everyone else, there is always an incentive to be loud, controversial or oversell because that&amp;rsquo;s what gets the attention. The exception to this is people who write and share high-quality things, but this is very hard.</description></item><item><title>Trading advice from Ramesh Damani</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-advice-from-ramesh-damani/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-advice-from-ramesh-damani/</guid><description>A Tradingqna user pointed to a video of Ramesh Damani where he says, Trading is always done by slip book &amp;amp; not chequebook &amp;amp; asked what it meant.

It started with a response to a part-time job offer on WhatsApp. The first few tasks were about leaving fake reviews for resorts &amp;amp; restaurants in random places like Peru. ~Rs 30k was transferred to the bank for the tasks completed. A Telegram group was created with others who claimed to do these tasks.
The next task for the group was to trade on a mock crypto platform, following a bunch of rules.</description></item><item><title>No amount of money can buy good health.
