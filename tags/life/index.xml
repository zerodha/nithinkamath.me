Many were in debt. Some had never thought about savings or budgeting. We spent 2 days together learning the basics of financial literacy through Varsity with the help of Svatah Foundation and Pankh India.
But instead of stopping there, we kept in touch and continued helping them for 2 years. Today, most of these women are debt-free. For someone from a low-income background, that&amp;rsquo;s true financial independence.</description></item><item><title>Creating experiences centered on health with Peakst8</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/creating-experiences-centered-on-health-with-peakst8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/creating-experiences-centered-on-health-with-peakst8/</guid><description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve grown older, I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly health-conscious. If I could go back in time and change one thing, I would&amp;rsquo;ve started focusing on diet, nutrition and sleep much earlier.
With each passing year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking more about health and fitness, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to encourage those around me, both personally and at work, to prioritise their health.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also realised that simple and repeatable behaviours make the biggest difference.</description></item><item><title>The one thing I wish I’d done differently after my stroke</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-one-thing-i-wish-id-done-differently-after-my-stroke/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-one-thing-i-wish-id-done-differently-after-my-stroke/</guid><description>If there’s one thing I wish I had done differently when I was hit by a stroke last January, it would be to go to the hospital immediately, within the Golden Hour (&amp;lt;4.5 hours), instead of thinking I could just sleep it off.
This “nothing will happen to me” attitude is common, especially among those under 50. But the truth is, strokes are rising sharply, up to nearly 30% of all strokes in the last few years, among 30 to 50-year-olds.</description></item><item><title>Some moments from Hyrox event</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/some-moments-from-the-hyrox-event/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/some-moments-from-the-hyrox-event/</guid><description>Turns out being old at HYROX has an advantage. #3 in my age category. 😬
Seema the cancer survivor killing the circuit as well. 😶
And Nikhil’s birthday party followed by a killer WTF offline event hosted by Nik.

And yes, I was “judged” for the first time since school — group discussions and all. 😬
I didn’t win. As Zerodha, we’re building only for India, with a single source of revenue. I guess the judges were looking for something more global, more diversified.</description></item><item><title>My Recovery Journey</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/my-recovery-journey/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/my-recovery-journey/</guid><description>So, yeah, fourteen months after the stroke, my body is almost back to normal 😬, and my mind is at about 85%.
My writing hasn’t improved at all. Maybe because I don’t practice enough. My speech is, well… about 85%.</description></item><item><title>EY Entrepreneur of the Year 2024</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/ey-entrepreneur-of-the-year-2024/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/ey-entrepreneur-of-the-year-2024/</guid><description>This is what the top of the bull market looks like with a lag 😬. A broker winning the EY entrepreneur of the year 2024.

On this occasion, my mom, Nikhil, Seema, and all of us at Zerodhaare proud to help set up the upcoming IISc Medical School/Bagchi-Parthasarathy Hospital in his memory.</description></item><item><title>India's diversity feels unmatched globally</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indias-diversity-feels-unmatched-globally/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indias-diversity-feels-unmatched-globally/</guid><description>I recently returned from visiting several countries in Europe. Everything feels like a cut, copy, and paste with very small differences.
In contrast, India is more like a continent than a country. The diversity in terms of languages, food, culture, etc., between the 28 states and within each state is nuts.
Every time I think of this, I am amazed at how the country actually came together.</description></item><item><title>Impromptu AMRAP workout</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impromptu-amrap-workout/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impromptu-amrap-workout/</guid><description>Impromptu AMRAP workout when Sisters in Sweat were at work 😀 1 min x pushups.</description></item><item><title>Telemarketing these days</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/telemarketing-these-days/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/telemarketing-these-days/</guid><description>My phone has become unusable due to telemarketing and is always silent. Guess what goes around comes around.
I spent four years at a call center, making unsolicited calls to people in the US. I guess Karma has a way of biting back. 😬</description></item><item><title>Recovering from a minor health scare</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/recovering-from-a-minor-health-scare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/recovering-from-a-minor-health-scare/</guid><description>Around 6 weeks ago, I had a mild stroke out of the blue. Dad passing away, poor sleep, exhaustion, dehydration, and overworking out —any of these could be possible reasons.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from having a big droop in the face and not being able to read or write to having a slight droop but being able to read and write more. From being absent-minded to more present-minded. So, 3 to 6 months for full recovery.</description></item><item><title>Importance of having a steady relationship</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/importance-of-having-a-steady-relationship/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/importance-of-having-a-steady-relationship/</guid><description>Here is a counter-argument in an age of short-term relationships: A steady relationship is underrated. Not having a volatile personal life makes life better. It also improves the odds of doing well personally and professionally.
We humans are social creatures, and we are hardwired to seek partners. But I don’t think a perfect partner exists. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and relationships are about compromises. Having said that, sometimes people aren&amp;rsquo;t compatible, and in such cases, ending the relationship makes sense.</description></item><item><title>You'll be missed, Mr Munger</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/youll-be-missed-mr-munger/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/youll-be-missed-mr-munger/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;I had written this about Mr. Charlie Munger in last year&amp;rsquo;s business update. His ideas have had a tremendous influence on me professionally. You’ll be missed, Mr. Munger. 🖤&amp;rdquo;
I have been reading and listening to quite a bit of Charlie Munger over the last few days. Every time I go down this rabbit hole, I tend to discover more about myself and what I think Zerodha should be. If I had to summarise, I could use some of his quotes (link to full post in comments)</description></item><item><title>Benefits of playing a sport</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/benefits-of-playing-a-sport/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/benefits-of-playing-a-sport/</guid><description>The one thing that has helped me remain sane and deal with the volatility of life is playing a sport regularly. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t just helped me reduce stress and anxiety, but I think it has also improved my cognitive abilities. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m almost forced to make healthier lifestyle choices when playing a sport regularly.
Given the benefits of playing a sport, picking up one If you can is a no-brainer, especially for kids.</description></item><item><title>Age is just a number</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</guid><description>Turned 44 today at 14.3% body fat, the lowest I have been. Sharing publicly for accountability, so I don’t slack and revert back to the mean, 🥶and maybe inspire a few folks and remind that age is just a number. 😬
And thanks everyone for the birthday wishes.</description></item><item><title>The downsides of social media</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-downsides-of-social-media/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-downsides-of-social-media/</guid><description>This desire to build large social media followings can be a slippery slope.
People are generally curious about successful &amp;amp; famous people, so it&amp;rsquo;s easier for celebs from movies, sports, etc., maybe even some businessmen 😀, to build a social media presence quickly.
For everyone else, there is always an incentive to be loud, controversial or oversell because that&amp;rsquo;s what gets the attention. The exception to this is people who write and share high-quality things, but this is very hard.</description></item><item><title>Trading advice from Ramesh Damani</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-advice-from-ramesh-damani/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-advice-from-ramesh-damani/</guid><description>A Tradingqna user pointed to a video of Ramesh Damani where he says, Trading is always done by slip book &amp;amp; not chequebook &amp;amp; asked what it meant.

Thanks, Ramesh, for taking the time to share the response to my cold email. 😃 Here is the link to the full post.</description></item><item><title>Beware of crypto and other online scams</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/beware-of-crypto-and-other-online-scams/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/beware-of-crypto-and-other-online-scams/</guid><description>Someone I know got scammed &amp;amp; lost money.
It started with a response to a part-time job offer on WhatsApp. The first few tasks were about leaving fake reviews for resorts &amp;amp; restaurants in random places like Peru. ~Rs 30k was transferred to the bank for the tasks completed. A Telegram group was created with others who claimed to do these tasks.
The next task for the group was to trade on a mock crypto platform, following a bunch of rules.</description></item><item><title>No amount of money can buy good health.
