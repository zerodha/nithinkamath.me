Brokerage on MTF can add up faster than you think 😬
MTF is a leveraged product, so you are already taking a significant risk. If you don’t pay attention to costs while using leverage, the math gets worse because your breakeven point moves higher for the trade.
Rule of thumb: on shorter holding periods and smaller price moves, brokerage can be the difference between breakeven and a loss.</description></item><item><title>Simplifying Corporate NPS with PensionBox</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/simplifying-corporate-nps-with-pensionbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/simplifying-corporate-nps-with-pensionbox/</guid><description>In FY25, around 72% of taxpayers chose the New Tax Regime. At Zerodha, that number was over 90%.
This shift makes sense. The new tax regime trades deductions for simpler filing and lower tax rates. For many—especially younger salaried taxpayers, avoiding paperwork-heavy exemptions matters more than maximising deductions.
With most deductions removed, salaried employees are left with the ₹75,000 standard deduction and one meaningful tax-saving option: the employer contribution to NPS, commonly called Corporate NPS.</description></item><item><title>Why we don't provide personal and credit card loans through Zerodha Capital</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-we-dont-provide-personal-and-credit-card-loans-through-zerodha-capital/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-we-dont-provide-personal-and-credit-card-loans-through-zerodha-capital/</guid><description>Someone on our team recently asked, &amp;ldquo;Why do we only offer Loan Against Securities on Zerodha Capital?&amp;rdquo; Why not personal loans or credit cards with their higher interest rates?
The simple answer is we can&amp;rsquo;t do anything different there. And our cost of funds doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. We&amp;rsquo;re at ~8.5%, while banks raise money at ~3.5%, and large NBFCs around ~7%.
Can&amp;rsquo;t compete on rates, and usually the best borrowers go where the rates are the lowest.</description></item><item><title>Protect your assets by adding a nominee</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/protect-your-assets-by-adding-a-nominee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/protect-your-assets-by-adding-a-nominee/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s ₹104,000 crores worth of money and investments lying unclaimed across banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds. The number is from a post by our PM Narendra Modi.
Despite the nomination process being fully online and despite repeated nudges, 62% of Zerodha users with holdings don&amp;rsquo;t have a nominee. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t added any nominees, it takes barely a couple of minutes.
While adding nominees is a good first step, you still have to inform the nominees.</description></item><item><title>Big reasons why term insurance applications get rejected</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/big-reasons-why-term-insurance-applications-get-rejected/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/big-reasons-why-term-insurance-applications-get-rejected/</guid><description>Getting adequate life insurance if you have dependents is the first thing you should do before you save, invest, etc. Having said that, not all life insurance policy applications are approved.
The Ditto team was telling me that 30% of term life insurance applications get rejected. Apparently, one of their biggest teams internally helps customers navigate policy rejections.
Big reasons why applications get rejected.
If you need assistance with insurance, you can schedule a call with an insurance advisor at Ditto</description></item><item><title>Teaching finance and markets online with Varsity Live</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/teaching-finance-and-markets-online-with-varsity-live/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/teaching-finance-and-markets-online-with-varsity-live/</guid><description>I think we&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a way to teach finance and markets online with both quality and scale with Varsity Live.
