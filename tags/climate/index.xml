If the quality of life deteriorates, there will be a tipping point where people just give up and start moving from large cities to places with better living conditions. If this happens, it will cause serious economic damage from reduced tax revenues, falling land values, and further degradation of civic infrastructure among other issues.</description></item><item><title>The importance of long-term support for philanthropy in the social sector</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-long-term-support-for-philanthropy-in-the-social-sector/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-long-term-support-for-philanthropy-in-the-social-sector/</guid><description>As part of Rainmatter, I get to be in meetings &amp;amp; learn from the smartest people in the social sector, like #ClimateRISE today. The thing I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand is why Philanthropy/CSR is oriented toward funding projects &amp;amp; not supporting organizations over the long-term.
In both profit and non-profit organizations, the odds of creating returns or impact are highest when you find the right founders and give them enough runway to experiment.</description></item><item><title>The many benfits of hemp</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-many-benfits-of-hemp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-many-benfits-of-hemp/</guid><description>Hemp belongs to the Cannabis sativa familyâ€”the same as marijuana. They look similar, but hemp is versatile and has multiple uses, including as a superfood. It&amp;rsquo;s also good for the planet. Unlike its notorious cousin, hemp doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you high ðŸ˜¬. Partly why it isn&amp;rsquo;t popular.
Because they look alike and come from the same family, hemp is often mistaken for marijuana, which is one reason why it isn&amp;rsquo;t mainstream.</description></item><item><title>Electric vehicles vs. internal combustion engines</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/electric-vehicles-versus-internal-combustion-engines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/electric-vehicles-versus-internal-combustion-engines/</guid><description>I assumed, like many, that electric vehicles (EVs) weren&amp;rsquo;t as green since most electricity in India is generated by burning coal, plus the transmission losses and emissions from battery production. Tarun Mehta recently explained why EVs are still much better emissions-wise.
This is mainly because of the internal combustion engine&amp;rsquo;s (ICE) inefficiency.

If Indians switched to efficient fans, Govt can save â‚¹575Cr &amp;amp; homes â‚¹6000/year Small change, big impact.

But we understand that the biggest impact can be made by individuals. Planting trees is a good start &amp;amp; we have been trying to help by giving free saplings.
