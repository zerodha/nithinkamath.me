It had become a sewage drain, and they turned it back into a flowing river. Made me think about especially of Delhi&amp;rsquo;s air quality problem.
They mapped 249 waste entry points with drones and installed traps. Rerouted sewage to treatment plants and built new ones. Set up a facility for textile waste from factories.</description></item><item><title>Prayoga students contribute to Global Science</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/prayoga-students-contribute-to-global-science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/prayoga-students-contribute-to-global-science/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something awesome 😍
Reshma, Lakshmi, Kirat, and Yamini are four young 8th- and 9th-standard girls from rural and socially disadvantaged communities in Karnataka. They published a scientific research paper in a peer-reviewed international journal on an innovative method for synthesizing copper oxide nanoparticles for water purification, with the help of three researchers from Prayoga. What&amp;rsquo;s even more impressive is that these girls are the first in their families to go to school.</description></item><item><title>WTF is Longevity with Bryan Johnson</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/wtf-is-longevity-with-bryan-johnson/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/wtf-is-longevity-with-bryan-johnson/</guid><description>The biggest takeaway for me after meeting Bryan Johnson was debunking the myth I once believed: that only Delhi in India has an air quality problem—and that it occurs only in winter.
We recorded Nikhil’s WTF podcast in a sea-facing apartment in Bandra, Mumbai, and the AQI was a whopping 160+. If the AQI was this high in Bandra, just imagine the levels in the more crowded parts of the town.</description></item><item><title>Reducing CO₂ emissions with faster software</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/reducing-co-emissions-with-faster-software/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/reducing-co-emissions-with-faster-software/</guid><description>The topic of reducing emissions from our software came up yesterday, and when I asked K about it, he said this. 😃

By the way, this data only covers until 2019, and things have only gotten worse in the last five years.
Maybe a property price discount for the quality of air and water is the solution. If economics accounted for this, maybe we would all figure this out. Essentially the air and water quality determines the rate for the property.</description></item><item><title>Boson White Water with its wastewater solutions</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/boson-white-water-with-its-wastewater-solutions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/boson-white-water-with-its-wastewater-solutions/</guid><description>It just took one bad rainy season for Bengaluru to face a massive water shortage crisis. Given that extreme weather conditions will only become more common, this probably won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time we face this crisis.
I learned recently that wastewater could be part of the solution. Bengaluru&amp;rsquo;s total freshwater demand is ~2632 (million litres a day) MLD, and it generates ~2000 MLD of wastewater. Of this, centralized sewage treatment plants treat ~1,300 MLD, and this water is used for agricultural purposes.</description></item><item><title>Wheels in motion, a short film on Rainmatter</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/wheels-in-motion-a-short-film-on-rainmatter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/wheels-in-motion-a-short-film-on-rainmatter/</guid><description>The more I interact with Sameer Shisodia, who heads Rainmatter Foundation, our foundation team, and people from social organizations, the more I appreciate the need for a vibrant social sector.
Like how startups can help solve some problems that larger companies can’t due to legacy reasons or because of their size, which makes getting things done harder, the social sector can attempt to experiment with solutions that can benefit society but are hard for the Government &amp;amp; bureaucracy to attempt given its sheer size.</description></item><item><title>Pollution's impact on Indian Health and Economy</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/pollutions-impact-on-indian-health-and-economy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/pollutions-impact-on-indian-health-and-economy/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s growing evidence to show that air and water pollution increases the risk of type 2 diabetes among Indians.
If the quality of life deteriorates, there will be a tipping point where people just give up and start moving from large cities to places with better living conditions. If this happens, it will cause serious economic damage from reduced tax revenues, falling land values, and further degradation of civic infrastructure among other issues.</description></item><item><title>The importance of long-term support for philanthropy in the social sector</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-long-term-support-for-philanthropy-in-the-social-sector/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-long-term-support-for-philanthropy-in-the-social-sector/</guid><description>As part of Rainmatter, I get to be in meetings &amp;amp; learn from the smartest people in the social sector, like #ClimateRISE today. The thing I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand is why Philanthropy/CSR is oriented toward funding projects &amp;amp; not supporting organizations over the long-term.
In both profit and non-profit organizations, the odds of creating returns or impact are highest when you find the right founders and give them enough runway to experiment.</description></item><item><title>The many benfits of hemp</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-many-benfits-of-hemp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-many-benfits-of-hemp/</guid><description>Hemp belongs to the Cannabis sativa family—the same as marijuana. They look similar, but hemp is versatile and has multiple uses, including as a superfood. It&amp;rsquo;s also good for the planet. Unlike its notorious cousin, hemp doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you high 😬. Partly why it isn&amp;rsquo;t popular.
Because they look alike and come from the same family, hemp is often mistaken for marijuana, which is one reason why it isn&amp;rsquo;t mainstream.</description></item><item><title>Electric vehicles vs. internal combustion engines</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/electric-vehicles-versus-internal-combustion-engines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/electric-vehicles-versus-internal-combustion-engines/</guid><description>I assumed, like many, that electric vehicles (EVs) weren&amp;rsquo;t as green since most electricity in India is generated by burning coal, plus the transmission losses and emissions from battery production. Tarun Mehta recently explained why EVs are still much better emissions-wise.
This is mainly because of the internal combustion engine&amp;rsquo;s (ICE) inefficiency.
