The simple answer is we can&amp;rsquo;t do anything different there. And our cost of funds doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. We&amp;rsquo;re at ~8.5%, while banks raise money at ~3.5%, and large NBFCs around ~7%.
Can&amp;rsquo;t compete on rates, and usually the best borrowers go where the rates are the lowest.</description></item></channel></rss>
