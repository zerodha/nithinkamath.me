2026: Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, says LLMs can generate code better than he can write.
It&amp;rsquo;s remarkable how good these large language models have become in such a short span of time, to the point where they&amp;rsquo;re on par with, or better than, humans across numerous domains.
K (Kailash) recently wrote a brilliant post about how software development, as we&amp;rsquo;ve known it for decades, is over.</description></item><item><title>Get realtime company updates on WhatsApp with Tijori Alerts</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/get-realtime-company-updates-on-whatsapp-with-tijori-alerts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/get-realtime-company-updates-on-whatsapp-with-tijori-alerts/</guid><description>Access to information is what drives prices in markets. While there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of information today, the real challenge is figuring out what actually matters and getting it in time.
Exchange filings, earnings, management commentary, and conference calls. When something material comes out, prices react almost instantly. The faster you get the information, the better your odds of reacting sensibly.
Institutions and high-frequency trading desks scan exchange filings the moment they&amp;rsquo;re published and act within milliseconds.</description></item><item><title>If you want to build something, India has never offered better odds</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/if-you-want-to-build-something-india-has-never-offered-better-odds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/if-you-want-to-build-something-india-has-never-offered-better-odds/</guid><description>There’s a lot of pessimism about India’s growth prospects right now, amplified by the sheer amount of geopolitical drama we’re living through. But if we aren’t hopeful that India will do better, then everything becomes moot.
This isn’t to say we don’t have real problems. We do. But every successful country has had to deal with its own share of thorny challenges along its development path. What matters is how we respond.</description></item><item><title>Curiosity will be the biggest advantage in age of AI</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/curiosity-will-be-the-biggest-advantage-in-age-of-ai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/curiosity-will-be-the-biggest-advantage-in-age-of-ai/</guid><description>A conversation on our internal forum.
Vignesh: With AI getting smarter every day, able to handle complex tasks in minutes or even seconds, and turning a comms head Bhuvan into a programmer, what’s the one skill you believe will always remain irreplaceable?
Nithin: Curiosity. I think everyone needs the ability to remain curious. In the world of AI, people who are curious will have an advantage. Curious about what? About everything.</description></item><item><title>Zerodha's Kite MCP is now live</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodhas-kite-mcp-is-now-live/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodhas-kite-mcp-is-now-live/</guid><description>These AI tools have become so good that you can have a reasonably competent personal financial assistant. To make this easier, we just launched Kite&amp;rsquo;s Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCPs are a new way for AI systems to interact with real-world services like trading accounts, for example.
With MCP, you can securely connect your Zerodha account to an AI assistant like Claude and do a variety of things like get portfolio insights, plan trades, backtest strategies, build personal finance dashboards, and much more.</description></item><item><title>India and the need for a long-term vision in AI &amp; Innovation</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-and-the-need-for-a-long-term-vision-in-ai-innovation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-and-the-need-for-a-long-term-vision-in-ai-innovation/</guid><description>In the 1960s-1970s, India and China had roughly the same per capita GDP. They started their reforms in the 1980s, and by 1990, they had overtaken our per capita GDP. Say what you will about the differences in our worldviews and economic models, but their scientific and technological progress is undeniable across disciplines—DeepSeek is just the latest example.
I saw this chart in an Economist article. It gives you a quick and dirty idea of the progress China has made despite the fact that papers and citations can be gamed.</description></item><item><title>Deepfakes' impact on the future of identity verification in financial services in the AI era</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/deepfakes-impact-on-the-future-of-identity-verification-in-financial-services-in-the-ai-era/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/deepfakes-impact-on-the-future-of-identity-verification-in-financial-services-in-the-ai-era/</guid><description>The rise of AI technology and deepfakes pose a large risk to the financial services industry.
The tipping point for Indian financial services businesses was when onboarding became completely digital, thanks to Aadhaar, etc. For businesses onboarding a new customer, an important aspect is ensuring that the documents and the person opening the account are real.
