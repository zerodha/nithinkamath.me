NRI accounts are also much higher in value compared to resident Indian accounts, by at least 10 times.
Hardly a day goes by without emails or messages from NRIs asking us to make account opening easier at Zerodha. The paperwork today is onerous, especially the need to visit an embassy.</description></item><item><title>Simplifying NRI investments at Zerodha</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/simplifying-nri-investments-at-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/simplifying-nri-investments-at-zerodha/</guid><description>NRI account opening reminds me of how retail broking worked before it became digital, thanks to Aadhaar, e-Sign, and Digilocker. Physical applications, couriers back &amp;amp; forth, ~30+ signatures, &amp;amp; more reasons to drop off. Many NRIs want to invest in India but don&amp;rsquo;t because of the onerous account opening process and the added notarizing &amp;amp; international courier costs.
To open an NRI account, you must fill out physical forms and notarize the documents by visiting banks or embassies.</description></item><item><title>Attracting NRIs by making it easy for them to invest at GIFT City</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/attracting-nris-by-making-it-easy-for-them-to-invest-at-gift-city/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/attracting-nris-by-making-it-easy-for-them-to-invest-at-gift-city/</guid><description>SGXNifty turning to GIFTNifty and moving to India will add momentum for GIFT City to become a true International financial centre. Congrats NSE India and Ashish Chauhan
If we could find a way to allow NRIs to easily invest in India through GIFT, I think we can attract a lot of capital. Due to the cumbersome processes, many NRIs are sitting on the fence and not investing in India.
The NRI account opening process today involves attestation of documents from the embassy, opening PIS bank accounts, and tax deduction at source (TDS) is applicable after every sale transaction.</description></item></channel></rss>
