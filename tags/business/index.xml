Starting from October 14th, shares bought will be directly credited to the customer&amp;rsquo;s Demat account through net settlement. This significantly simplifies our DP process, which today involves receiving shares for the entire group of clients and then allocating them based on purchases made, i.e., gross settlement.
And this is much safer, too.</description></item><item><title>Impact of SEBI's on new rules for index derivatives</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-sebis-cirular-on-new-rules-for-index-derivatives/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-sebis-cirular-on-new-rules-for-index-derivatives/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the potential impact of only one weekly expiry of index derivatives per exchange and contract sizes going up by around 2.5 times.
As things stand, assuming that those trading weekly don&amp;rsquo;t move on to trading monthly, the impact will be ~60% of overall F&amp;amp;O trades and ~30% of our overall orders.
I guess things will become much clearer from November 20th. We will then decide on our change in pricing structure, based on the impact on the business.</description></item><item><title>Impact of revision in Exchange Transaction Charges and STT</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-revision-in-exchange-transaction-charges-and-stt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-revision-in-exchange-transaction-charges-and-stt/</guid><description>Equity delivery will continue to be free at @zerodhaonline.

From today, Oct 1, 2024,
For options: STT increases to 0.1% from 0.0625%, and transaction charge decreases to 0.035% from 0.0495%.

The suggested changes, even with the STT increase, won‚Äôt really change options volumes. But on the flipside, they will reduce futures volumes.
From what I‚Äôve seen at Zerodha, futures traders have higher odds of making money than option buyers. On a gross basis, futures traders are profitable about 50% of the time as opposed to options traders, who are only profitable about 10% of the time.</description></item><item><title>SEBI‚Äôs ‚Äútrue to label‚Äù circular</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-true-to-label-circular/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-true-to-label-circular/</guid><description>SEBI issued a new circular mandating all market infrastructure institutions, like stock exchanges, to be &amp;ldquo;true to the label&amp;rdquo; in how they levy charges. This circular has a significant impact on brokers, traders, and investors.
Stock exchanges charge transaction fees based on the overall turnover contributed by brokers. The difference between what the brokers charge the customer and what the exchange charges the broker at the end of the month is a rebate, which goes to brokers.</description></item><item><title>Why Zerodha doesn't advertise</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-zerodha-doesnt-advertise/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-zerodha-doesnt-advertise/</guid><description>I watched a cricket match after a long time, and damn!

I often get asked, both internally and externally, why we don&amp;rsquo;t advertise.
It is a good place to be when you don&amp;rsquo;t have to look at customers in terms of acquisition costs (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV).

Our 13th year was dedicated to streamlining, overhauling and refactoring the behind-the-scenes systems, and R&amp;amp;D, paving the way for several new products and features we have in the pipeline.
Looking back, maybe we didn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job proactively sharing updates, which might have made you feel like nothing new was happening at Zerodha.</description></item><item><title>You need both physical and digital presence to reach more customers in India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/you-need-both-physical-and-digital-presence-to-reach-more-customers-in-india/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/you-need-both-physical-and-digital-presence-to-reach-more-customers-in-india/</guid><description>HDFC Bank opening 4 new branches daily last year is phenomenal.
As counterintuitive as it sounds, I think the real competition for most Fintechs in India is the branches of all banks. Each bank branch sells everything from loans, investments, insurance, and more.

This is because the performance of broking is directly tied to market performance. If people aren‚Äôt making money or there is no greed, activity usually drops off a cliff.

Me: I don‚Äôt think it will be another stock brokerage firm or a new stock exchange. It will most likely be an outsider, maybe Crypto. Here is why.
In broking or exchange business, both on pricing and product, there is not much left to disrupt. Unless of course, someone figures a way to pay people money for trading (-ve brokerage not allowed by regulation) or figures a way to help all customers make money (very tough)</description></item><item><title>Zerodha's 11th birthday.</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodha-turns-eleven/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodha-turns-eleven/</guid><description>Happy Independence day üáÆüá≥.

If Nifty does well, business outperforms the market by a fair bit, and if Nifty doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it underperforms the market by a fair bit.</description></item><item><title>How big was Jan 2021 for the broking industry?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/how-big-was-jan-2021-for-broking/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/how-big-was-jan-2021-for-broking/</guid><description>How big was Jan 2021 for the broking industry? The best year for the markets since 2010 was by far 2014. Nifty was up more than 30% and the industry added 13 lakh new Demat accounts in 1 year. And, Jan 2021, just in 1 month 17 lakh new Demat accounts were added.

I had shared this pre-Covid. Broking is super hot now, but this TAM (Total addressable market) hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed, if anything it has reduced. Btw, the revenue-generating active day traders + F&amp;amp;O crowd is not more than ~1.5mil in spite of the spike in trading activity/volumes. This active crowd is unlikely to go up because most day and F&amp;amp;O traders stop within 6 months.</description></item><item><title>Why advertising doesn't work</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-advertising-doesnt-work/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-advertising-doesnt-work/</guid><description>https://freakonomics.com/podcast/advertising-part-2/ This is a great listen from Freakonomics on whether advertising works. The reason we could bootstrap was that we never spent on ads. With no ads, a business is forced to constantly think &amp;amp; do things to get customer love and organic growth. The only time we experimented with ads was for our brand keyword, show our website if you search &amp;ldquo;Zerodha&amp;rdquo;. We stopped immediately when we realized that it made no difference to the traffic and the ad was essentially cannibalizing our organic traffic while costing us money.</description></item><item><title>The flipside of effecient companies</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-flipside-of-effecient-companies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-flipside-of-effecient-companies/</guid><description>https://zenx.medium.com/the-six-dots-problem-re-imagining-india-b7d81b223827 The flip side of tech-first businesses like ours is that we don&amp;rsquo;t create as many jobs. We are around the same number of employees today at 3.8mn clients as we were when we had 1mn clients. As @kunalb11 says, inefficiency is the biggest employer in the world. A way to solve this employment problem is to enable jobs(economy) not just in the top 6 cities, but maybe 600 towns/villages. The only +ve this year has been that maybe some it is happening.</description></item><item><title>Forbes cover</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/forbes-cover/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/forbes-cover/</guid><description>https://tradingqna.com/t/personal-lessons-from-20-years-of-trading-broking-working/94600
Almost unreal that we could represent Zerodha on the cover of Forbes. Some personal lessons from the many highs &amp;amp; many lows in this 20-year journey working, trading, trying to build different types of businesses, &amp;amp; more.
Businesses can be built in multiple ways. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to cut-copy-paste what others are doing - it mostly won‚Äôt work. Do what feels right to you. Your instincts on what is right will work better when you build a business/career around what you love.</description></item><item><title>CRED curious: Nithin Kamath in conversation with Kunal Shah</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/cred-curious-nithin-kamath-in-conversation-with/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/cred-curious-nithin-kamath-in-conversation-with/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Nikhil and Me on SNFConversations</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/nikhil-and-me-on-snfconversations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/nikhil-and-me-on-snfconversations/</guid><description>They say it is tough to be in business with family. @kamath_nikhil &amp;amp; I have been doing stuff together forever, never a fight &amp;amp; couldn&amp;rsquo;t have had a better partner.
