Here&amp;rsquo;s the context: Our AUM share is growing (people with more money trust us), but our demat share is shrinking (fewer new accounts). The people with money are sticking with us, but many others aren&amp;rsquo;t opening accounts with us üò¨. Most likely, the newer and younger, and people from tier 2 and 3 towns, are probably investing elsewhere.</description></item><item><title>About MCP and the future of investing and trading in a world of AI</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/about-mcp-and-the-future-of-investing-and-trading-in-a-world-of-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/about-mcp-and-the-future-of-investing-and-trading-in-a-world-of-ai/</guid><description>I keep asking K about what all this progress in AI means for our business. It feels to me like we&amp;rsquo;re at the very beginning of a massive shift in how financial services will work.
At some point, I think all of it, from investing and trading to banking and payments, will happen through custom AI-powered apps built by users themselves using natural language instructions.
In that world, what&amp;rsquo;s the role of a broker?</description></item><item><title>What we think about Jio-BlackRock's entry into broking</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/what-we-think-about-jio-blackrocks-entry-into-broking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/what-we-think-about-jio-blackrocks-entry-into-broking/</guid><description>Many people asked me about Jio-BlackRock getting a stockbroking license. Firstly, this is great news. The biggest issue for the Indian markets is a lack of breadth in participation. We&amp;rsquo;re largely limited to the top 10 crore Indians.
If anyone can expand the markets beyond the top 10 crore Indians, it&amp;rsquo;s probably Jio with all its distribution might. As for how many new Indian investors have the money to invest in the market, I don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description></item><item><title>At the EY's World Entrepreneur event</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/at-the-eys-world-entrepreneur-event/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/at-the-eys-world-entrepreneur-event/</guid><description>Spent the last week in Monaco at the EY World Entrepreneur of the Year event ‚Äî the first time I‚Äôve ever been part of something like this. And yes, I was ‚Äújudged‚Äù for the first time since school ‚Äî group discussions and all. üò¨
I didn‚Äôt win. As Zerodha, we‚Äôre building only for India, with a single source of revenue. I guess the judges were looking for something more global, more diversified.</description></item><item><title>Are Play Store and App Store ratings truly reliable?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/are-play-store-and-app-store-ratings-truly-reliable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/are-play-store-and-app-store-ratings-truly-reliable/</guid><description>I wonder how many Google Play Store and Apple App Store reviews are genuine. I was going through Zerodha&amp;rsquo;s reviews and compared them with those of other financial services apps in India. Most of the 5-star reviews seem fake‚Äîmany even read like AI-generated content.
I&amp;rsquo;m guessing many apps are either willingly or forcibly buying ratings to rank higher in their category. So there&amp;rsquo;s probably an entire parallel economy selling app ratings.</description></item><item><title>Why Zerodha chose no Ads</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-zerodha-chose-no-ads/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-zerodha-chose-no-ads/</guid><description>Over 1.6 crore Indians trade and invest with us. Almost 30% of these investors came to us through referrals by other Zerodha customers. Today, all Zerodha investors trust us with 6 lakh crores of their assets.
We may be the only B2C company to have reached this scale without ever advertising. In hindsight, not advertising has helped us stay true to our philosophy of not pushing people to trade, no spam, etc.</description></item><item><title>Why we chose CDSL</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-we-chose-cdsl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-we-chose-cdsl/</guid><description>We started our business as a depository participant in 2016, and we had to choose between NSDL &amp;amp; CDSL. We only went ahead with CDSL because they had a local representative, Harisha, in Bengaluru.
After that, pretty much all the other new brokers also chose CDSL. Of course, this only worked because CDSL ensured that their tech could handle the scale of all this new business.
The increase in CDSL demats from 2016 was almost entirely due to Harisha and the butterfly effectü¶ã üòÄ</description></item><item><title>Regulations are like a double-edged sword</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/regulations-are-like-a-double-edged-sword/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/regulations-are-like-a-double-edged-sword/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a saying, &amp;ldquo;You live by the sword, you die by the sword.&amp;rdquo; For regulated business, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;you live by regulations and die by regulations.&amp;rdquo;
Regulations are like a double-edged sword. They can be a moat for the business, but at the same time, they can make your business model invalid overnight. Regulations are easier when explicit (SEBI) than implicit (RBI), but I guess it is because RBI has to regulate a wide variety of intermediaries.</description></item><item><title>SEBI's new rules for direct payout of securities</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-new-rules-for-direct-payout-of-securities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-new-rules-for-direct-payout-of-securities/</guid><description>While SEBI is tightening rules to make the markets safer on the one hand, it is also making things simple on the other.
Starting from October 14th, shares bought will be directly credited to the customer&amp;rsquo;s Demat account through net settlement. This significantly simplifies our DP process, which today involves receiving shares for the entire group of clients and then allocating them based on purchases made, i.e., gross settlement.
And this is much safer, too.</description></item><item><title>Impact of SEBI's on new rules for index derivatives</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-sebis-cirular-on-new-rules-for-index-derivatives/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-sebis-cirular-on-new-rules-for-index-derivatives/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the potential impact of only one weekly expiry of index derivatives per exchange and contract sizes going up by around 2.5 times.
As things stand, assuming that those trading weekly don&amp;rsquo;t move on to trading monthly, the impact will be ~60% of overall F&amp;amp;O trades and ~30% of our overall orders.
I guess things will become much clearer from November 20th. We will then decide on our change in pricing structure, based on the impact on the business.</description></item><item><title>Impact of revision in Exchange Transaction Charges and STT</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-revision-in-exchange-transaction-charges-and-stt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-revision-in-exchange-transaction-charges-and-stt/</guid><description>Equity delivery will continue to be free at @zerodhaonline.

From today, Oct 1, 2024,
For options: STT increases to 0.1% from 0.0625%, and transaction charge decreases to 0.035% from 0.0495%.
This results in the cost of trades seeing a net increase of 0.02303% or Rs 2303 per crore of premium on the selling side on NSE and of 0.</description></item><item><title>14-years of Zerodha</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/14-years-of-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/14-years-of-zerodha/</guid><description>A few highlights from FY2023/24 @zerodhaonline

So, we are stopping our referral programme and making one-time payouts for whatever is due.

The suggested changes, even with the STT increase, won‚Äôt really change options volumes. But on the flipside, they will reduce futures volumes.
From what I‚Äôve seen at Zerodha, futures traders have higher odds of making money than option buyers. On a gross basis, futures traders are profitable about 50% of the time as opposed to options traders, who are only profitable about 10% of the time.</description></item><item><title>SEBI‚Äôs ‚Äútrue to label‚Äù circular</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-true-to-label-circular/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-true-to-label-circular/</guid><description>SEBI issued a new circular mandating all market infrastructure institutions, like stock exchanges, to be &amp;ldquo;true to the label&amp;rdquo; in how they levy charges. This circular has a significant impact on brokers, traders, and investors.
Stock exchanges charge transaction fees based on the overall turnover contributed by brokers. The difference between what the brokers charge the customer and what the exchange charges the broker at the end of the month is a rebate, which goes to brokers.</description></item><item><title>Why Zerodha doesn't advertise</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-zerodha-doesnt-advertise/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-zerodha-doesnt-advertise/</guid><description>I watched a cricket match after a long time, and damn! Every fourth ad is that of a brokerage firm. Sign of good times for the marketsüòÄ
I often get asked, both internally and externally, why we don&amp;rsquo;t advertise.
It is a good place to be when you don&amp;rsquo;t have to look at customers in terms of acquisition costs (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV). This way, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to push customers to take a trade, we can stay spam-free, not have to sell life insurance as an investment, and more.</description></item><item><title>2023 at Zerodha</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/2023-at-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/2023-at-zerodha/</guid><description>2023 was a busy year for us at Zerodha, with the majority focus on backend and behind-the-scenes changes, be it technology, operations, compliance, or customer support. Our 13th year was dedicated to streamlining, overhauling and refactoring the behind-the-scenes systems, and R&amp;amp;D, paving the way for several new products and features we have in the pipeline.
Looking back, maybe we didn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job proactively sharing updates, which might have made you feel like nothing new was happening at Zerodha.</description></item><item><title>You need both physical and digital presence to reach more customers in India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/you-need-both-physical-and-digital-presence-to-reach-more-customers-in-india/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/you-need-both-physical-and-digital-presence-to-reach-more-customers-in-india/</guid><description>HDFC Bank opening 4 new branches daily last year is phenomenal.
As counterintuitive as it sounds, I think the real competition for most Fintechs in India is the branches of all banks. Each bank branch sells everything from loans, investments, insurance, and more.
Other than small-value consumer loans &amp;amp; payments, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is possible to expand the market or increase market share beyond a certain point by being digital only.</description></item></channel></rss>
