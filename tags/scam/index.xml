It&amp;rsquo;s your &amp;ldquo;bank.&amp;rdquo; The caller knows your credit card number and claims there&amp;rsquo;s an unauthorized charge they can help reverse. They send you a WhatsApp link to download your bank&amp;rsquo;s app.
Seems legitimate, right? That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what the scammers want you to think.
The moment you enter your banking details into this fake app, your money is gone. This new scam has already cost victims lakhs and crores of their hard-earned savings.</description></item></channel></rss>
