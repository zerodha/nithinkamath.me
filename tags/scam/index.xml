These scams work by creating fear in people. They take advantage of people&amp;rsquo;s tendency to make mistakes when they are afraid.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how the scam works:
You get a call from a person claiming to be a police officer. They tell you that a courier parcel in your name has been seized because it contains illegal items like drugs or other contraband.</description></item><item><title>Think it's your bank calling?

It&amp;rsquo;s your &amp;ldquo;bank.&amp;rdquo; The caller knows your credit card number and claims there&amp;rsquo;s an unauthorized charge they can help reverse. They send you a WhatsApp link to download your bank&amp;rsquo;s app.
Seems legitimate, right? That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what the scammers want you to think.
The moment you enter your banking details into this fake app, your money is gone. This new scam has already cost victims lakhs and crores of their hard-earned savings.</description></item></channel></rss>
