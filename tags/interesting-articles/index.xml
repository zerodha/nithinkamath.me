Over the next 10 days, there are only 4 trading days. Itâ€™s not a bad idea to take a break from trading and recharge. Judging by whatâ€™s happening, youâ€™re going to need it. ðŸ˜¬
&amp;ldquo;Trading profitably requires that you monitor the market moods and your psychological moods. When either one is not conducive to trading, itâ€™s best to stand aside and wait for the situation to change.</description></item><item><title>Effects of GLP-1 drugs</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/effects-of-glp1-drugs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/effects-of-glp1-drugs/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the developments around Ozempic and GLP-1 drugs with some interest for a while, and last week Eli Lilly launched its variant, Mounjaro, in India. Remember, India has the highest number of diabetics, and if current trends hold, 30%+ of Indians will be obese. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we have a good understanding of the second-order effects of these weight loss drugs, but so far, the effects people are reporting are remarkable.</description></item><item><title>Trade tariffs and Global Power</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trade-tariffs-and-global-power/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trade-tariffs-and-global-power/</guid><description>The way Donald Trump has gone about imposing tariffs and making statements about other countries makes it feel like we are all subjects of the &amp;ldquo;US empire,&amp;rdquo; if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t evident till now.
In terms of trade, China today is the largest trading partner for over 120 countries. In terms of financial and military dominance, the US remains the most powerful nation, for now.
The question is, will the stance of &amp;ldquo;America first&amp;rdquo; backfire or not?</description></item><item><title>India and the need for a long-term vision in AI &amp; Innovation</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-and-the-need-for-a-long-term-vision-in-ai-innovation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-and-the-need-for-a-long-term-vision-in-ai-innovation/</guid><description>In the 1960s-1970s, India and China had roughly the same per capita GDP. They started their reforms in the 1980s, and by 1990, they had overtaken our per capita GDP. Say what you will about the differences in our worldviews and economic models, but their scientific and technological progress is undeniable across disciplinesâ€”DeepSeek is just the latest example.
I saw this chart in an Economist article. It gives you a quick and dirty idea of the progress China has made despite the fact that papers and citations can be gamed.</description></item><item><title>The Flip Side of Easy Loans in India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-flip-side-of-easy-loans-in-india/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-flip-side-of-easy-loans-in-india/</guid><description>After the pandemic, there&amp;rsquo;s been a big increase in personal loans and credit card borrowings. The good side of this is the deepening of credit, but the bad side is some people seem to have borrowed too much or borrowed despite not being able to afford it. A lot of these are small ticket loans under Rs 10,000 from fintech apps. I wonder how much of this is due to the incessant spam from these loan apps nudging people to take &amp;ldquo;instant pre-approved&amp;rdquo; loans.</description></item><item><title>The only longevity advice you need</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-only-longevity-advice-you-need/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-only-longevity-advice-you-need/</guid><description>This is brilliant advice from the legendary Edward Thorp, who at 92 is still going strong.

My understanding of it is it should be ok for savvy traders using APIs for individual trading with some reasonable order limits. But the APIs have to be accessed through only static IPs, but this isnâ€™t hard to get.
But platforms that offer algos or readymade strategies will need to get them approved through the broker. The broker, in turn, has to register all algos and strategies with the exchanges.</description></item><item><title>Reducing COâ‚‚ emissions with faster software</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/reducing-co-emissions-with-faster-software/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/reducing-co-emissions-with-faster-software/</guid><description>The topic of reducing emissions from our software came up yesterday, and when I asked K about it, he said this. ðŸ˜ƒ

If the quality of life deteriorates, there will be a tipping point where people just give up and start moving from large cities to places with better living conditions. If this happens, it will cause serious economic damage from reduced tax revenues, falling land values, and further degradation of civic infrastructure among other issues.</description></item><item><title>Why Zerodha doesn't have a data team</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-zerodha-doesnt-have-a-data-team/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-zerodha-doesnt-have-a-data-team/</guid><description>How useful is collecting &amp;amp; analysing tons of data is a question I ask my peers.
