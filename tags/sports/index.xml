Imagine studying something you don&amp;rsquo;t like or being stuck in a field when you know that your skills are useful elsewhere. Odds are, you may end up being less than average compared to people who are more suited to the field you hate. In this case, how can you expect job security?</description></item><item><title>Helping nurture the next generation of Indian athletes</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/helping-nurture-the-next-generation-of-indian-athletes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/helping-nurture-the-next-generation-of-indian-athletes/</guid><description>I think one of the easiest ways to be healthy is to pick up a sport you like. The one thing that helps people pick up a sport is seeing someone inspiring. Imagine how many Indians play cricket because of Sachin, etc.

It hasn&amp;rsquo;t just helped me reduce stress and anxiety, but I think it has also improved my cognitive abilities. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m almost forced to make healthier lifestyle choices when playing a sport regularly.
Given the benefits of playing a sport, picking up one If you can is a no-brainer, especially for kids.</description></item></channel></rss>
