This allows you to visualize your account performance, and you can compare it to a benchmark like Nifty 50. We&amp;rsquo;re probably the only broker to offer this feature in India and possibly worldwide.
The performance curve is calculated in a similar way to the NAV of mutual funds. The daily NAV is calculated using the P&amp;amp;L of all trades across equity intraday and delivery, F&amp;amp;O, commodities, MTF, and mutual funds based on the cash in the account.</description></item><item><title>Important updates on Kite</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/important-updates-on-kite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/important-updates-on-kite/</guid><description>Some important updates on Kite by Zerodha.

The original idea was to help traders and investors make better decisions, like helping them avoid going against the trend, being diversified, etc. In many ways, they were well ahead of their time. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to make the platform work while complying with regulations.
Abid went back to trading options for a trading desk, but I continued peddling him the idea that he should start something related to the markets.</description></item><item><title>Introducing MTF on Kite</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-mtf-on-kite/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-mtf-on-kite/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it is a good time with the fall in the markets ðŸ˜¬, but we are finally launching MTF (margin trading facility) which allows you to buy stocks for delivery by borrowing money from us.

Customers who trade for delivery tend to ignore the impact of the cost of borrowing, and there&amp;rsquo;s always the risk of the trade going against them, which leads to a bigger loss.</description></item><item><title>Search by brand feature on Kite web</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/search-by-brand-feature-on-kite-web/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/search-by-brand-feature-on-kite-web/</guid><description>We just added the Search by Brands feature on Zerodha.
