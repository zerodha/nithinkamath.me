The tipping point for Indian financial services businesses was when onboarding became completely digital, thanks to Aadhaar, etc. For businesses onboarding a new customer, an important aspect is ensuring that the documents and the person opening the account are real.
The normal process that&amp;rsquo;s followed today is to fetch the ID or address proof data from the source using Digilocker and or Aadhaar.</description></item><item><title>The downsides of social media</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-downsides-of-social-media/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-downsides-of-social-media/</guid><description>This desire to build large social media followings can be a slippery slope.
People are generally curious about successful &amp;amp; famous people, so it&amp;rsquo;s easier for celebs from movies, sports, etc., maybe even some businessmen ðŸ˜€, to build a social media presence quickly.
For everyone else, there is always an incentive to be loud, controversial or oversell because that&amp;rsquo;s what gets the attention. The exception to this is people who write and share high-quality things, but this is very hard.</description></item><item><title>The importance of net neutrality</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-net-neutrality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-net-neutrality/</guid><description>Recently, there have been talks of re-visiting the idea of net neutrality in India. We enjoy some of the strongest net neutrality rules in the world, ensuring a fair and level playing field for everyone to access and innovate on the internet, no matter how big and small.
The exponential growth of our technology and startup ecosystem would not have been possible without this. Without net-neutrality, there perhaps would not have been a Zerodha.</description></item><item><title>Potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on mankind and capitalism.</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/potential-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-mankind-and-capitalism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/potential-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-mankind-and-capitalism/</guid><description>It took us ~30 mins to integrate commoditized ChatGPT, see tangible benefits, and realize that more than 20% of jobs could be automated. Now, imagine what more intelligent tools could lead to?

Why be so transparent? No security concerns sharing all this info? So yeah, answers from the man behind the scene - Dr. K
Why Free &amp;amp; Open source software?
Superior utility: Pretty much everything in the known universe uses FOSS, from the Mars rovers to our phones to washing machines.</description></item><item><title>The journey of Omnesys</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-journey-of-omnesys/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-journey-of-omnesys/</guid><description>The number of things that have to align for a business to get off the ground and do well is ridiculous. Zerodha could start with a bare minimum capital and no tech background in 2010 only because NSE India offered NOW, a free trading platform built by Omnesys.
Over the years, Omnesys has changed hands many times, and it&amp;rsquo;s finally back home, where I was invited to open their first officeâ€”the circle of life ðŸ˜¬</description></item></channel></rss>
