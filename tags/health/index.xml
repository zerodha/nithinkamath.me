By the way, this data only covers until 2019, and things have only gotten worse in the last five years.
Maybe a property price discount for the quality of air and water is the solution. If economics accounted for this, maybe we would all figure this out. Essentially the air and water quality determines the rate for the property.</description></item><item><title>Diabetes a ticking time bomb for India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/diabetes-a-ticking-time-bomb-for-india/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/diabetes-a-ticking-time-bomb-for-india/</guid><description>Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.
There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person&amp;rsquo;s disease. But that&amp;rsquo;s no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.
The scary part is the rate at which it&amp;rsquo;s affecting young Indians. If you&amp;rsquo;re a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.</description></item><item><title>Air pollution is deadlier than smoking</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/air-pollution-is-deadlier-than-smoking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/air-pollution-is-deadlier-than-smoking/</guid><description>Air pollution is deadlier than smoking, drinking, or AIDS (you only have to read this report from Down to Earth to figure that out) and right now, it appears countries like China, US, and others in Europe are doing a far better job than India in reining it in.

Ideally, we need to see calories as a percentage of daily calories, proteins, etc.
One large chocolate milkshake has 1000+ calories, or 40% of an average person&amp;rsquo;s calorie intake, which is about 2500 calories.
But showing that a food contains 40% of the total calories that a person consumes in a day might reduce the sales of a lot of things.</description></item><item><title>The Rainmatter Health story</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-rainmatter-health-story/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-rainmatter-health-story/</guid><description>Many of us inside Zerodha are conscious of our health, and we keep having discussions about food, fitness, nutrition, health gadgets, etc. Inevitably, these discussions would lead to questions like &amp;ldquo;Is the atta we consume safe?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Does milk have harmful antibiotics?&amp;rdquo; etc. To get answers, we would try to find domain experts and entrepreneurs, and some of the answers we often got weren&amp;rsquo;t pretty, as I alluded to in a previous tweet.</description></item><item><title>Awareness can improve our food choices</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/awareness-can-improve-our-food-choices/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/awareness-can-improve-our-food-choices/</guid><description>We Indians need to question what goes into the food we consume. The more we ask, the better choices we will have. The sugar content in most of our food is ridiculous. Adulteration in food items like masalas, milk and protein. And then there are substandard chemicals used in food coloring and preservatives in fruits and vegetables.
They are all slowly killing us. This applies to both packaged foods and food from many restaurants.</description></item><item><title>Recovering from a minor health scare</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/recovering-from-a-minor-health-scare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/recovering-from-a-minor-health-scare/</guid><description>Around 6 weeks ago, I had a mild stroke out of the blue. Dad passing away, poor sleep, exhaustion, dehydration, and overworking out â€”any of these could be possible reasons.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from having a big droop in the face and not being able to read or write to having a slight droop but being able to read and write more. From being absent-minded to more present-minded. So, 3 to 6 months for full recovery.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Fittr</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-fittr/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-fittr/</guid><description>When a popular coffee chain started displaying that their large milkshake had a whopping 1000 calories, I thought the sales would drop off a cliff, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t budge. This is maybe an indication of a low understanding of things that can affect peopleâ€™s health.
Through Rainmatter Health, we have been looking to support people helping Indians make healthier choices. We are super excited to partner with FITTR as they attempt to solve this challenge from multiple angles:</description></item><item><title>The Otherside podcast with Rohan Bopanna</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-otherside-podcast-with-rohan-bopanna/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-otherside-podcast-with-rohan-bopanna/</guid><description>Playing a sport you enjoy is one of the most accessible ways to be physically and mentally fit. Doing well in sports is also a great way to build on national identity and pride. If more Indians have to play a sport &amp;amp; be healthier, maybe those who have played sports at the highest levels are best placed to popularize sports.
It is fantastic to see sportsmen like Rohan Bopanna sponsoring other athletes, running academies and investing in sports businesses.</description></item><item><title>Benefits of playing a sport</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/benefits-of-playing-a-sport/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/benefits-of-playing-a-sport/</guid><description>The one thing that has helped me remain sane and deal with the volatility of life is playing a sport regularly. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t just helped me reduce stress and anxiety, but I think it has also improved my cognitive abilities. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m almost forced to make healthier lifestyle choices when playing a sport regularly.
Given the benefits of playing a sport, picking up one If you can is a no-brainer, especially for kids.</description></item><item><title>Pollution's impact on Indian Health and Economy</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/pollutions-impact-on-indian-health-and-economy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/pollutions-impact-on-indian-health-and-economy/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s growing evidence to show that air and water pollution increases the risk of type 2 diabetes among Indians.
If the quality of life deteriorates, there will be a tipping point where people just give up and start moving from large cities to places with better living conditions. If this happens, it will cause serious economic damage from reduced tax revenues, falling land values, and further degradation of civic infrastructure among other issues.</description></item><item><title>Companies should help employees become healthier</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/companies-should-help-employees-become-healthier/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/companies-should-help-employees-become-healthier/</guid><description>We came first in the corporate team category at the half at IRONMAN Triathlon in Goa today. Dilip running the half marathon, Vishnucycling 90km, and me swimming 1.9km.
Ridiculous that we came first with a total time of whopping 6.2 hours. ðŸ˜¬ An indicator of how maybe more needs to be done at corporates in India to focus on health and fitness, and participating in events like this is a good nudge.</description></item><item><title>Age is just a number</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</guid><description>Turned 44 today at 14.3% body fat, the lowest I have been.

A few things I learned recently:
Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. Due to overuse, germs have become resistant to antibiotics, leading to health complications and deaths. The non-obvious way in which we ingest antibiotics is through dairy and meat. For example, cows that are always tied down tend to catch diseases quickly, and the use of antibiotics becomes necessary to treat them.</description></item><item><title>Preparing for some fitness challnge is a good hack to stay motivated</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/preparing-for-some-fitness-challnge-is-a-good-hack-to-stay-motivated/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/preparing-for-some-fitness-challnge-is-a-good-hack-to-stay-motivated/</guid><description>Preparing for events like marathons, obstacle and fitness races, triathlons, etc., is an incredible hack to stay motivated on your health journey. If you are starting your journey, then signing up for such events is also a good way to push yourself to start.
Adnan Adeeb and I just ran the super challenging Hyrox fitness race, having spent the last couple of months preparing for it.

Strength training is integral to increasing healthspan &amp;amp; we need more to focus on this. There is enough research to prove that exercise delays death &amp;amp; prevents cognitive &amp;amp; physical decline better than any other intervention.
Most Indians think that you don&amp;rsquo;t need strength training as you age. The truth is strength training becomes even more critical as we get older, especially after our 40s.</description></item><item><title>No amount of money can buy good health.

Similarly, best way to limit screen time is to add non-screen experiences. For me, the only true digital detox is playing a physical sport.
&amp;ldquo;As with any bad habit, perhaps the best way to break it isnâ€™t to put our energy into resisting the siren song, but into singing a different tune. In a self-regulation society, that might be the best we can do.</description></item></channel></rss>
