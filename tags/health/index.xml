Dilip running the half marathon, Vishnucycling 90km, and me swimming 1.9km.
Ridiculous that we came first with a total time of whopping 6.2 hours. ðŸ˜¬ An indicator of how maybe more needs to be done at corporates in India to focus on health and fitness, and participating in events like this is a good nudge.</description></item><item><title>Age is just a number</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/age-is-just-a-number/</guid><description>Turned 44 today at 14.3% body fat, the lowest I have been. Sharing publicly for accountability, so I donâ€™t slack and revert back to the mean, ðŸ¥¶and maybe inspire a few folks and remind that age is just a number. ðŸ˜¬
And thanks everyone for the birthday wishes.</description></item><item><title>A few things I learned about food and sustainability</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-things-i-learned-about-food-and-sustainability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-things-i-learned-about-food-and-sustainability/</guid><description>Every time I speak or listen to Shashi from Akshayakalpa, I learn something new about food, health, and sustainability. A few things I learned recently:
Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. Due to overuse, germs have become resistant to antibiotics, leading to health complications and deaths. The non-obvious way in which we ingest antibiotics is through dairy and meat. For example, cows that are always tied down tend to catch diseases quickly, and the use of antibiotics becomes necessary to treat them.</description></item><item><title>Preparing for some fitness challnge is a good hack to stay motivated</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/preparing-for-some-fitness-challnge-is-a-good-hack-to-stay-motivated/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/preparing-for-some-fitness-challnge-is-a-good-hack-to-stay-motivated/</guid><description>Preparing for events like marathons, obstacle and fitness races, triathlons, etc., is an incredible hack to stay motivated on your health journey. If you are starting your journey, then signing up for such events is also a good way to push yourself to start.
Adnan Adeeb and I just ran the super challenging Hyrox fitness race, having spent the last couple of months preparing for it. Adnan has to be one of the fittest 50+ senior citizens ðŸ˜œ I know.</description></item><item><title>Physical and mental health are among the most important aspects in life</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/physical-and-mental-health-are-among-the-most-important-aspects-in-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/physical-and-mental-health-are-among-the-most-important-aspects-in-life/</guid><description>Life is like a marathon, and you need to be able to finish strong. Physical and mental health are among the most important aspects in life. You can&amp;rsquo;t buy good health with all the money in the world.
I try to get a workout first thing in the morning with Seema; it also acts like our bonding exercise. ðŸ˜€ A workout first thing also means I make better choices with food throughout the day.</description></item><item><title>The importance of strength training for Indians</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-strength-training-for-indians/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-strength-training-for-indians/</guid><description>Only about 50 lakhs or 0.3% of Indians go to a gym. Strength training is integral to increasing healthspan &amp;amp; we need more to focus on this. There is enough research to prove that exercise delays death &amp;amp; prevents cognitive &amp;amp; physical decline better than any other intervention.
Most Indians think that you don&amp;rsquo;t need strength training as you age. The truth is strength training becomes even more critical as we get older, especially after our 40s.</description></item><item><title>No amount of money can buy good health.

Not that we need a day to remind us, but no amount of money can buy good health. Being healthy needn&amp;rsquo;t be complicated; small lifestyle changes can make a huge difference.
I&amp;rsquo;m highlighting some people who&amp;rsquo;ve transformed with such changes in my life.
Venu is the man behind all operations &amp;amp; compliance at Zerodha.

Similarly, best way to limit screen time is to add non-screen experiences. For me, the only true digital detox is playing a physical sport.
&amp;ldquo;As with any bad habit, perhaps the best way to break it isnâ€™t to put our energy into resisting the siren song, but into singing a different tune. In a self-regulation society, that might be the best we can do.</description></item></channel></rss>
