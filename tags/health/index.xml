We&amp;rsquo;re creating participatory sports events through an initiative called Peakst8 Club. We&amp;rsquo;ve been going around the country with Founders Peak—getting health founders (and others) to participate, not just network over coffee.
Last weekend was our first grand event: &amp;ldquo;No Parking.&amp;rdquo; Booked the entire basement at Brigade, Orion Mall (thanks, Nirupa Shankar!), Bengaluru. Around 1,000 runners representing 38 corporates, 45 communities, and 43 run clubs were participating in various activities, including running, rowing, cycling, and more.</description></item><item><title>Discussion with Adnan from Devils Circuit on fitness and health</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/discussion-with-adnan-from-devils-circuit-on-fitness-and-health/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/discussion-with-adnan-from-devils-circuit-on-fitness-and-health/</guid><description>Of everyone I’ve met, Adnan has to be one of the most passionate advocates for fitness and getting Indians to participate in active sports. His company, Devils Circuit, has faced its fair share of obstacles and ups and downs — but the mission remains strong: inspiring Indians to take a greater interest in their health and fitness.
And my gut tells me, the time when we truly start caring more about our health is coming soon.</description></item><item><title>The one thing I wish I’d done differently after my stroke</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-one-thing-i-wish-id-done-differently-after-my-stroke/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-one-thing-i-wish-id-done-differently-after-my-stroke/</guid><description>If there’s one thing I wish I had done differently when I was hit by a stroke last January, it would be to go to the hospital immediately, within the Golden Hour (&amp;lt;4.5 hours), instead of thinking I could just sleep it off.
This “nothing will happen to me” attitude is common, especially among those under 50. But the truth is, strokes are rising sharply, up to nearly 30% of all strokes in the last few years, among 30 to 50-year-olds.</description></item><item><title>Creating safe spaces in sexual health discussions through Rainmatter</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/creating-safe-spaces-in-sexual-health-discussions-through-rainmatter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/creating-safe-spaces-in-sexual-health-discussions-through-rainmatter/</guid><description>The one important type of health we don&amp;rsquo;t talk about is sexual health for obvious reasons. But the numbers are scary:
Male infertility now accounts for 50% of infertility cases in India.
1 in 10 Indian men experience erectile dysfunction. India has one of the highest rates of untreated STIs globally, especially among youth and migrant populations. 56% of Indian women report some form of sexual dysfunction.
Over the last few years, we&amp;rsquo;ve realised that health issues among Indians have increased and will continue to increase because of poor quality food, air, water, and lifestyles in general.</description></item><item><title>Some moments from Hyrox event</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/some-moments-from-the-hyrox-event/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/some-moments-from-the-hyrox-event/</guid><description>Turns out being old at HYROX has an advantage. #3 in my age category. 😬

Reshma, Lakshmi, Kirat, and Yamini are four young 8th- and 9th-standard girls from rural and socially disadvantaged communities in Karnataka. They published a scientific research paper in a peer-reviewed international journal on an innovative method for synthesizing copper oxide nanoparticles for water purification, with the help of three researchers from Prayoga. What&amp;rsquo;s even more impressive is that these girls are the first in their families to go to school.</description></item><item><title>Sport startups we're proud to support</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sport-startups-were-proud-to-support/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sport-startups-were-proud-to-support/</guid><description>One of the issues with fitness is that gyms and similar facilities feel boring for a lot of people. I&amp;rsquo;ve always said that a better way to stay fit is to play a sport you enjoy because it won&amp;rsquo;t feel like a chore. Sports are also more accessible for a lot of people.
With this in mind, we&amp;rsquo;ve supported many sports-focused startups that are trying to get more Indians to pick up a sport through Rainmatter.</description></item><item><title>India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-is-at-the-epicentre-of-the-global-diabetes-epidemic/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-is-at-the-epicentre-of-the-global-diabetes-epidemic/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something worrying from a recent earnings call of a beverage maker: Indian&amp;rsquo;s are consuming more soft drinks than ever. Even Indian companies have said something similar. Remember, India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.</description></item><item><title>My Recovery Journey</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/my-recovery-journey/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/my-recovery-journey/</guid><description>So, yeah, fourteen months after the stroke, my body is almost back to normal 😬, and my mind is at about 85%.
My writing hasn’t improved at all. Maybe because I don’t practice enough. My speech is, well… about 85%.</description></item><item><title>Effects of GLP-1 drugs</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/effects-of-glp1-drugs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/effects-of-glp1-drugs/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the developments around Ozempic and GLP-1 drugs with some interest for a while, and last week Eli Lilly launched its variant, Mounjaro, in India. Remember, India has the highest number of diabetics, and if current trends hold, 30%+ of Indians will be obese. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we have a good understanding of the second-order effects of these weight loss drugs, but so far, the effects people are reporting are remarkable.</description></item><item><title>WTF is Longevity with Bryan Johnson</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/wtf-is-longevity-with-bryan-johnson/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/wtf-is-longevity-with-bryan-johnson/</guid><description>The biggest takeaway for me after meeting Bryan Johnson was debunking the myth I once believed: that only Delhi in India has an air quality problem—and that it occurs only in winter.
We recorded Nikhil’s WTF podcast in a sea-facing apartment in Bandra, Mumbai, and the AQI was a whopping 160+. If the AQI was this high in Bandra, just imagine the levels in the more crowded parts of the town.</description></item><item><title>The only longevity advice you need</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-only-longevity-advice-you-need/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-only-longevity-advice-you-need/</guid><description>This is brilliant advice from the legendary Edward Thorp, who at 92 is still going strong.

By the way, this data only covers until 2019, and things have only gotten worse in the last five years.
Maybe a property price discount for the quality of air and water is the solution. If economics accounted for this, maybe we would all figure this out. Essentially the air and water quality determines the rate for the property.</description></item><item><title>Diabetes a ticking time bomb for India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/diabetes-a-ticking-time-bomb-for-india/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/diabetes-a-ticking-time-bomb-for-india/</guid><description>Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.
There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person&amp;rsquo;s disease. But that&amp;rsquo;s no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.
The scary part is the rate at which it&amp;rsquo;s affecting young Indians. If you&amp;rsquo;re a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.</description></item><item><title>Air pollution is deadlier than smoking</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/air-pollution-is-deadlier-than-smoking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/air-pollution-is-deadlier-than-smoking/</guid><description>Air pollution is deadlier than smoking, drinking, or AIDS (you only have to read this report from Down to Earth to figure that out) and right now, it appears countries like China, US, and others in Europe are doing a far better job than India in reining it in.

Ideally, we need to see calories as a percentage of daily calories, proteins, etc.
One large chocolate milkshake has 1000+ calories, or 40% of an average person&amp;rsquo;s calorie intake, which is about 2500 calories.
But showing that a food contains 40% of the total calories that a person consumes in a day might reduce the sales of a lot of things.</description></item><item><title>The Rainmatter Health story</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-rainmatter-health-story/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-rainmatter-health-story/</guid><description>Many of us inside Zerodha are conscious of our health, and we keep having discussions about food, fitness, nutrition, health gadgets, etc. Inevitably, these discussions would lead to questions like &amp;ldquo;Is the atta we consume safe?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Does milk have harmful antibiotics?&amp;rdquo; etc. To get answers, we would try to find domain experts and entrepreneurs, and some of the answers we often got weren&amp;rsquo;t pretty, as I alluded to in a previous tweet.</description></item><item><title>Awareness can improve our food choices</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/awareness-can-improve-our-food-choices/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/awareness-can-improve-our-food-choices/</guid><description>We Indians need to question what goes into the food we consume. The more we ask, the better choices we will have. The sugar content in most of our food is ridiculous. Adulteration in food items like masalas, milk and protein. And then there are substandard chemicals used in food coloring and preservatives in fruits and vegetables.
They are all slowly killing us. This applies to both packaged foods and food from many restaurants.</description></item><item><title>Recovering from a minor health scare</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/recovering-from-a-minor-health-scare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/recovering-from-a-minor-health-scare/</guid><description>Around 6 weeks ago, I had a mild stroke out of the blue. Dad passing away, poor sleep, exhaustion, dehydration, and overworking out —any of these could be possible reasons.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from having a big droop in the face and not being able to read or write to having a slight droop but being able to read and write more. From being absent-minded to more present-minded. So, 3 to 6 months for full recovery.</description></item></channel></rss>
