In just under two years, it&amp;rsquo;s incredible that the AUM has reached almost ₹6,000 crores.
All of this growth is organic, from traders and investors discovering the ETF and investing in it. We haven&amp;rsquo;t really spoken about it much, and you can&amp;rsquo;t pay commissions on an ETF anyway.
The innovation here was simple: no dividends, because they were tax-inefficient and a pain to redeem and track.</description></item><item><title>Zerodha Fund House crosses ₹8000 crores AUM</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodha-fund-house-crosses-8000-crores-aum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodha-fund-house-crosses-8000-crores-aum/</guid><description>Zerodha Fund House is almost 2 years old, and we have reached ~₹8,000 crores despite not talking much about it. What&amp;rsquo;s cool is that practically all of this AUM comes from individual investors.
The AMC has grown steadily even as competition has intensified, with newer AMCs entering the market and existing AMCs launching more passive funds. We could have grown our AUM faster by offering regular plans and paying commissions, but we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to remain direct-only and focus on easy-to-understand index funds and ETFs like our recently launched multi-asset fund (link in the replies).</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Zerodha Multi Asset Fund</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-the-zerodha-multi-asset-fund/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-the-zerodha-multi-asset-fund/</guid><description>After 20+ years of being in the markets, one thing has become crystal clear to me: most investors should just invest in low-cost equity, debt, and gold index funds and do something useful with their lives. 😬 Trying to pick the &amp;ldquo;best fund&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;best asset class&amp;rdquo; is largely a waste of time and energy.
What most investors don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that they&amp;rsquo;d get far better returns by focusing on maximizing their earning potential rather than obsessing over picking the &amp;ldquo;best stocks and funds.</description></item><item><title>Investors have saved ₹6,400 crores through Zerodha AMC</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/investors-have-saved-6400-crores-through-zerodha-amc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/investors-have-saved-6400-crores-through-zerodha-amc/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 18 months since the first fund launch of Zerodha Fund House with smallcase. The idea was to offer simple and cost-efficient index funds and ETFs and stay direct only. Despite not being loud about the AMC, 7 lakh investors have saved ₹6,400 crores in our funds.
The hero fund is LIQUIDCASE ETF at ₹4,700 crores, and this is all in 15 months. LIQUIDCASE has to be one of the most successful Indian retail ETF launches ever.</description></item><item><title>Are Gold ETFs the next best bet?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/are-gold-etfs-the-next-best-bet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/are-gold-etfs-the-next-best-bet/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m cherry-picking the date, but it&amp;rsquo;s kinda crazy that since 2000 gold seems to have generated higher returns than Nifty.
We couldn&amp;rsquo;t time the launch of the GOLDCASE, Zerodha Fund House&amp;rsquo;s Gold ETF any better😬 First, gold prices started shooting up and then the stopping of sovereign gold bonds (SGBs). Now that SGB issuance has stopped, Gold ETFs are probably the best way to get exposure to gold.
Gold has been kind to Indian investors and has provided some diversification benefit.</description></item><item><title>One year of Zerodha Fund House</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/one-year-of-zerodha-fund-house/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/one-year-of-zerodha-fund-house/</guid><description>This was our first year as India&amp;rsquo;s direct-only AMC, Zerodha Fund House. Our AUM has grown significantly, all without us actively pushing anything.
The good thing about being passive-only is that it aligns the incentives for both the customers and us. For the customers, it means access to good, low-cost products, and for us, it eliminates the risks that have recently made headlines.

The AUM crossed Rs 800 crores, and the volumes have been consistently picking up.
This is India&amp;rsquo;s first Liquid ETF with a growth NAV. Unlike other liquid ETFs, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with fractional units, figure out what your actual return is, and face issues when filing your taxes.</description></item><item><title>Introducing LIQUIDCASE, India's first ETF with a growth NAV</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-liquidcase-indias-first-etf-with-a-growth-nav/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-liquidcase-indias-first-etf-with-a-growth-nav/</guid><description>LIQUIDCASE, India&amp;rsquo;s first ETF with a growth NAV from ZerodhaAMC just listed today with the same symbol. When we were thinking about the product, we wanted to offer something simple where investors didn&amp;rsquo;t have to bother about dividends, taxes etc.
So, the way LIQUIDCASE works is simple: the returns in the ETF will be added to the NAV just like growth mutual funds, and there are no dividends. This makes it easier for you to track your returns, and there are no hassles with fractional units and figuring out your taxes.</description></item></channel></rss>
