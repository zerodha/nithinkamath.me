When we were thinking about the product, we wanted to offer something simple where investors didn&amp;rsquo;t have to bother about dividends, taxes etc.
So, the way LIQUIDCASE works is simple: the returns in the ETF will be added to the NAV just like growth mutual funds, and there are no dividends. This makes it easier for you to track your returns, and there are no hassles with fractional units and figuring out your taxes.</description></item></channel></rss>
