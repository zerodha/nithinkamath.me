What most investors don&amp;rsquo;t realize is that they&amp;rsquo;d get far better returns by focusing on maximizing their earning potential rather than obsessing over picking the &amp;ldquo;best stocks and funds.</description></item><item><title>Investors have saved â‚¹6,400 crores through Zerodha AMC</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/investors-have-saved-6400-crores-through-zerodha-amc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/investors-have-saved-6400-crores-through-zerodha-amc/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 18 months since the first fund launch of Zerodha Fund House with smallcase. The idea was to offer simple and cost-efficient index funds and ETFs and stay direct only. Despite not being loud about the AMC, 7 lakh investors have saved â‚¹6,400 crores in our funds.
The hero fund is LIQUIDCASE ETF at â‚¹4,700 crores, and this is all in 15 months. LIQUIDCASE has to be one of the most successful Indian retail ETF launches ever.</description></item><item><title>Are Gold ETFs the next best bet?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/are-gold-etfs-the-next-best-bet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/are-gold-etfs-the-next-best-bet/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m cherry-picking the date, but it&amp;rsquo;s kinda crazy that since 2000 gold seems to have generated higher returns than Nifty.
We couldn&amp;rsquo;t time the launch of the GOLDCASE, Zerodha Fund House&amp;rsquo;s Gold ETF any betterðŸ˜¬ First, gold prices started shooting up and then the stopping of sovereign gold bonds (SGBs). Now that SGB issuance has stopped, Gold ETFs are probably the best way to get exposure to gold.
Gold has been kind to Indian investors and has provided some diversification benefit.</description></item><item><title>One year of Zerodha Fund House</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/one-year-of-zerodha-fund-house/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/one-year-of-zerodha-fund-house/</guid><description>This was our first year as India&amp;rsquo;s direct-only AMC, Zerodha Fund House. Our AUM has grown significantly, all without us actively pushing anything.
The good thing about being passive-only is that it aligns the incentives for both the customers and us. For the customers, it means access to good, low-cost products, and for us, it eliminates the risks that have recently made headlines.

The AUM crossed Rs 800 crores, and the volumes have been consistently picking up.
This is India&amp;rsquo;s first Liquid ETF with a growth NAV. Unlike other liquid ETFs, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with fractional units, figure out what your actual return is, and face issues when filing your taxes.</description></item><item><title>Introducing LIQUIDCASE, India's first ETF with a growth NAV</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-liquidcase-indias-first-etf-with-a-growth-nav/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-liquidcase-indias-first-etf-with-a-growth-nav/</guid><description>LIQUIDCASE, India&amp;rsquo;s first ETF with a growth NAV from ZerodhaAMC just listed today with the same symbol. When we were thinking about the product, we wanted to offer something simple where investors didn&amp;rsquo;t have to bother about dividends, taxes etc.
So, the way LIQUIDCASE works is simple: the returns in the ETF will be added to the NAV just like growth mutual funds, and there are no dividends. This makes it easier for you to track your returns, and there are no hassles with fractional units and figuring out your taxes.</description></item></channel></rss>
