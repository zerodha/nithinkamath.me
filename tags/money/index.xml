Having said that, if the goal was to reduce speculative activity in F&amp;amp;O, then I&amp;rsquo;m not sure this will do anything.
95% of trading is already in options, and this STT increase will only push that share higher. Why? Because the impact falls mostly on futures, while options are far more speculative than futures.
If the govt wants to reduce speculation, then establishing product suitability (who can trade) criteria is the way to go.</description></item><item><title>Every budget, I hope STT comes down</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/every-budget-i-hope-stt-comes-down/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/every-budget-i-hope-stt-comes-down/</guid><description>As a market participant, I always hope the budget will reduce STT, but it keeps going up. STT was introduced when LTCG was made 0, but now that LTCG is back&amp;hellip; 😬
The 60% F&amp;amp;O STT increase from Budget 2024 (0.0125% → 0.02% on futures and 0.0625% → 0.1% on options) didn’t impact volumes much at first, the bull market continued with surging participation. But markets don’t always have bull runs; the impact showed up in the year we just had.</description></item><item><title>MTF has grown 5x, but broker risk models haven’t</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/mtf-has-grown-5x-but-broker-risk-models-havent/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/mtf-has-grown-5x-but-broker-risk-models-havent/</guid><description>MTF (margin funding) has grown ~5X in 4 years to ₹110k+ crores, especially after F&amp;amp;O margins and STT increases. But there&amp;rsquo;s something nobody&amp;rsquo;s talking about: there is no real risk model in play for brokers. 😬
Regulations allow up to 5X leverage (20% margin) on many stocks. Competition forces every broker to offer maximum permissible leverage. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, you lose business. Classic race to the bottom.
Unlike F&amp;amp;O, MTF has several risk multipliers: Clients hold positions for months vs days 1,300 stocks (many illiquid) allowed vs only the top 200 in F&amp;amp;O All buy positions vs two-way flow in F&amp;amp;O, making risk management much harder Much harder to manage risk, given all the above.</description></item><item><title>Make social security accessible for those who need it most</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/make-social-security-accessible-for-those-who-need-it-most/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/make-social-security-accessible-for-those-who-need-it-most/</guid><description>Most people from economically weaker sections aren’t aware of government schemes like PMSBY (₹20/year for ₹2 lakh accident cover) or PMJAY / Ayushman Bharat (₹5 lakh health cover).
We recently invited Haqdarshak to run an enrollment camp at our office for housekeeping, admin, and security staff. If you employ people, consider doing this. It removes all the usual barriers to enrollment. The schemes are well-designed; the real problem is awareness and access.</description></item><item><title>SEBI cautions against investing in digital gold</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebi-cautions-against-investing-in-digital-gold/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebi-cautions-against-investing-in-digital-gold/</guid><description>Digital gold is unregulated. A timely reminder from SEBI.
Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do.
It’s also a subpar way to get exposure to gold. You pay 3% GST the moment you buy. Then there are spreads of another 2–3%, which means as soon as you purchase digital gold, you’re already down about 6%, and that’s before even factoring in regulatory risk.</description></item><item><title>India’s $3 trillion in idle gold needs smarter financialization.</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indias-3-trillion-in-idle-gold-needs-smarter-financialization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indias-3-trillion-in-idle-gold-needs-smarter-financialization/</guid><description>Indian households hold ~$3 trillion in gold (World Gold Council estimate), sitting idle in lockers.

It’s very hard to consistently put customers first.
This is one of the main reasons why finance apps are full of dark patterns, more than almost any other category. Dark patterns are design tricks used in apps and websites to make you do things that are not in your best interest.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Money Mindful series</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-the-money-mindful-series/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-the-money-mindful-series/</guid><description>Despite all the interest in the stock market after COVID, there are still only 5 crore unique mutual fund investors. I&amp;rsquo;ve said this earlier as well—one of the biggest challenges for the Indian markets is the lack of an advisory ecosystem with just about 900 RIAs.
If you consider mutual fund distributors, there are about 2.7 lakh+ plus, but still not enough. For a broad comparison, there are over 27 lakh+ insurance agents.</description></item><item><title>Zerodha's growing AUM and investor profits</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodhas-growing-aum-and-investor-profits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodhas-growing-aum-and-investor-profits/</guid><description>Equity investors at Zerodha have realized a profit of Rs 50,000 crores over the last 4+ years and are sitting on unrealized profits of Rs 1,00,000 crores on an AUM of Rs 4,50,000 crores.

The number of people getting fleeced by shady and illegal loan apps has gone up significantly. Many individuals caught up in the web of these apps frequently resort to drastic actions, such as suicide.</description></item><item><title>SEBI's proposal to offer affordable corporate bonds and increase retail investor participation</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-proposal-to-offer-affordable-corporate-bonds-and-increase-retail-investor-participation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-proposal-to-offer-affordable-corporate-bonds-and-increase-retail-investor-participation/</guid><description>The latest consultation proposal by SEBI to reduce corporate bonds&amp;rsquo; face value to Rs 10,000 can lead to greater retail participation in the bond markets.
I think for the majority of our country, i.e. beyond the top 5 to 10% of the country yet to start investing, equities may not be the right instruments because they can be scary because of the volatility. A bad market phase or losses when they start will end with investors permanently leaving the markets.</description></item><item><title>Managing risk and growth in Financial services firms</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/managing-risk-and-growth-in-financial-services-firms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/managing-risk-and-growth-in-financial-services-firms/</guid><description>The mishaps at large financial institutions of crediting funds to the wrong persons serve as a reminder about one of the most significant risks of running a financial services firm.
Whether you are a broker, a bank, or any entity that directly settles with end customers, once securities or funds are sent to the wrong person, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get them back. This risk is like a hanging sword for these businesses.</description></item><item><title>Phishing frauds have gone thorugh the roof</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/phishing-frauds-have-gone-through-the-roof/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/phishing-frauds-have-gone-through-the-roof/</guid><description>The number of phishing frauds has gone through the roof, and everybody is being targeted. The only way to protect yourself is to not trust anybody asking for money or offering something that seems too good to be true. Here are a few types of frauds I have come across recently.
Impersonating Govt officials and other higher authorities and asking for charitable donations or money for other things. Many folks on our team have received social media and WhatsApp messages saying I was in some urgent need of money from fake accounts.</description></item><item><title>Financial freedom.</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/financial-freedom/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/financial-freedom/</guid><description>Financial freedom isn’t X amount.

In a world where everyone is triggering you to borrow &amp;amp; buy what you don’t need, being content &amp;amp; debt-free is true financial freedom.
