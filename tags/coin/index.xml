She visited her bank branch and asked to invest in mutual funds, but the manager kept pushing her to invest in an insurance product. She went back and did her homework, and this time she insisted on index mutual funds, but the manager was rude and said she couldn&amp;rsquo;t invest in them through the bank.
After much back and forth, the manager got her to invest in a regular plan of index funds.</description></item></channel></rss>
