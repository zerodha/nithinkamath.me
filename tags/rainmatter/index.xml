We applied under SEBI regulatory sandbox to launch the same in India. Our learnings by Somnath Mukherjee. We made that application with a startup that had reached out to us Rainmatterin and was rejected.
In the US, stocks bought by customers are held in the street name of the broker, unlike in India, where stocks are held in a customer’s beneficiary account with a depository.</description></item><item><title>Making insurance simple</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/making-insurance-simple/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/making-insurance-simple/</guid><description>Insurance unfortunately needs to be hard sold today. The issue is that most don’t understand why they need insurance. Even if they do, it&amp;rsquo;s tough to find unbiased advice. There&amp;rsquo;s just too much choice, complexity, mis-selling, &amp;amp; not to mention spam. Scares away most people.
Even at home, dad has bought a lot of horrible policies as investments vs insurance over the years. We have always wanted to do something about this problem.</description></item><item><title>Tax arbitrage between dividends and selling a stake and startup profitability</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/tax-arbitrage-between-dividends-and-selling-stake/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/tax-arbitrage-between-dividends-and-selling-stake/</guid><description>Can the tax arbitrage that exists between earning through dividends(~52%) vs earning through selling a stake (~24%) be the reason why most new-age businesses are not profitable? I think so. Money is like a river, it flows where the conditions are conducive to its flow.
The Govt capping the surcharge on LTCG when investing in unlisted companies to encourage investments in startups in the budget is a welcome move. But maybe the tax arbitrage shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so large that everyone just focuses on valuations and not on profits &amp;amp; sustainability.</description></item><item><title>Adoption of organic farming</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/organic-farming/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/organic-farming/</guid><description>I keep asking everyone who’s adopted organic farming if yields drop after they stopped using chemicals. In a world where short term gains trump long term improvements, it&amp;rsquo;s tough to see how the shift to organic — even if good for the planet, would happen if yields are lower.
In May, Sri Lanka banned chemical fertiliser and pesticides &amp;amp; went fully organic. There&amp;rsquo;s been an uproar over this move. Some people and groups have even blamed this move for the food crisis there.</description></item><item><title>Organic farming</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/adoption-of-organic-farming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/adoption-of-organic-farming/</guid><description>I keep asking everyone who’s adopted organic farming if yields drop after they stopped using chemicals.

We were quickly sold on their idea of getting users to invest in diversified baskets of stocks or ideas they understood vs single stocks, which reduced their risk.
We had just opened up Kite APIs. The idea was to enable startups to build platforms that could grow the shallow Indian capital market ecosystem.
Today, they&amp;rsquo;ve built an amazing ecosystem of products.</description></item><item><title>A few thoughts on the Zerodha journey so far</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-the-zerodha-journey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-the-zerodha-journey/</guid><description>Last 2 years have been spectacular for Zerodha . Lucky to be at right place right time, ready with products &amp;amp; initiatives when there was a surge in retail participation. With success, what I say gets valued more Grimacing faceHere are a few questions that we get asked frequently.
Why haven’t we raised any external capital, especially at times like these when we could get some crazy valuation?

Many also don&amp;rsquo;t file since it&amp;rsquo;s quite complex, but Quicko has simplified it drastically. In our new Rainmatter podcast I talk to Vishvajit on their journey.</description></item></channel></rss>
