Today, that number is about 30%. When I saw this spike, I was surprised and wanted to understand what had changed. So we ran a small survey among a couple of hundred customers.
Roughly 50% of the women use their accounts on their own, while the other 50% have their accounts managed by someone else, such as their husbands, brothers, or children.</description></item><item><title>Rainmatter investment in Capitalmind</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-capitalmind/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-capitalmind/</guid><description>It is sometimes surreal how life comes full circle.
Deepak Shenoy was among the first people I spoke to about the idea of Zerodha. When we started, he agreed to lend his credibility by having his name on our website as an advisor. üò¨
We&amp;rsquo;re happy to be backing him through Rainmatter, as Capitalmind continues its journey of now being an AMC.</description></item><item><title>Prayoga students contribute to Global Science</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/prayoga-students-contribute-to-global-science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/prayoga-students-contribute-to-global-science/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something awesome üòç
Reshma, Lakshmi, Kirat, and Yamini are four young 8th- and 9th-standard girls from rural and socially disadvantaged communities in Karnataka. They published a scientific research paper in a peer-reviewed international journal on an innovative method for synthesizing copper oxide nanoparticles for water purification, with the help of three researchers from Prayoga. What&amp;rsquo;s even more impressive is that these girls are the first in their families to go to school.</description></item><item><title>Sport startups we're proud to support</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sport-startups-were-proud-to-support/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sport-startups-were-proud-to-support/</guid><description>One of the issues with fitness is that gyms and similar facilities feel boring for a lot of people. I&amp;rsquo;ve always said that a better way to stay fit is to play a sport you enjoy because it won&amp;rsquo;t feel like a chore. Sports are also more accessible for a lot of people.
With this in mind, we&amp;rsquo;ve supported many sports-focused startups that are trying to get more Indians to pick up a sport through Rainmatter.</description></item><item><title>SCRA rules clarified</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/scra-rules-clarified/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/scra-rules-clarified/</guid><description>Finally, after clarification of SCRA rules by Ministry of Finance and NSE, brokers can now invest their own funds without exchange approvals or restrictions.
This is huge for Rainmatter. We can now allocate more capital to support Indian startups directly from the brokerage entity.</description></item><item><title>India must bet on research and innovation</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-must-bet-on-research-and-innovation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-must-bet-on-research-and-innovation/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s amazing that despite all the challenges, we&amp;rsquo;re now the 4th largest economy in the world. Having said that, at the risk of sounding like a spoilsport, GDP comparisons only tell you so much.
When you look at important metrics like productivity, labor force participation, and perhaps most importantly, R&amp;amp;D spending, we have a long way to go. India spends just 0.7% of GDP on R&amp;amp;D, while China spends 2.4%, South Korea 4.</description></item><item><title>Rainmatter investment in Zerodor</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-zerodor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-zerodor/</guid><description>We have been using Zerodor @EkamEco for the men‚Äôs urinals at our offices for the last six months or so. Our water bills are down 50%‚Äîwe did not expect it to be this much.
It seems like a no-brainer for offices, restaurants, etc., where we have managed washrooms.
They were on @sharktankindia around a year back. Here is how it works.
We liked the product because they are doing whatever is necessary to preserve water, which has become supercritical.</description></item><item><title>IISc x Rainmatter</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/iisc-x-rainmatter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/iisc-x-rainmatter/</guid><description>We recently partnered with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to create India‚Äôs first Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) Program for longevity.
Longevity isn‚Äôt just about living longer‚Äîit‚Äôs about living better. This program provides an opportunity for scientists, technologists, and aspiring entrepreneurs to build solutions at the intersection of deep science and technology.
India needs accessible and affordable healthcare solutions, and this program serves as a platform to encourage such innovation. The selected teams will work closely with IISc faculty at Longevity and our team at Rainmatter .</description></item><item><title>Nine years of Rainmatter</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/nine-years-of-rainmatter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/nine-years-of-rainmatter/</guid><description>At Rainmatter we invested about Rs 275 crores in 47 startups last year. It may seem like we&amp;rsquo;re investing in too many startups, but we aren&amp;rsquo;t a typical VC and don&amp;rsquo;t function like one. We don&amp;rsquo;t take board seats, have no exit clauses, and have a perennial structure (patient capital)‚Äîthat is, we are in it for the long term.
We may be early, but our thesis right now is that climate and health will be megatrends of the future.</description></item><item><title>Three years of climate action - Rainmatter reflections</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/three-years-of-climate-action-rainmtter-reflections/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/three-years-of-climate-action-rainmtter-reflections/</guid><description>The prelude to starting @RainmatterOrg in 2021, was that we decided to first get our hands dirty and took on a restoration project in 2020. As luck would have it, @zenx was running a campsite on the land, and that&amp;rsquo;s where we met. We hit it off almost immediately, and the Foundation was born.
Three years since we have a solid theme: chasing various intersections of things that impact the climate and the people and lives that it has an effect on.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Money Mindful series</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-the-money-mindful-series/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-the-money-mindful-series/</guid><description>Despite all the interest in the stock market after COVID, there are still only 5 crore unique mutual fund investors. I&amp;rsquo;ve said this earlier as well‚Äîone of the biggest challenges for the Indian markets is the lack of an advisory ecosystem with just about 900 RIAs.
If you consider mutual fund distributors, there are about 2.7 lakh+ plus, but still not enough. For a broad comparison, there are over 27 lakh+ insurance agents.</description></item><item><title>Rainmatter investment in LWL</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-lwl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-lwl/</guid><description>I was surprised to learn from Adityaghosh, the former head of IndiGo, that the percentage of women working at IndiGo went from 18% to 43% under his leadership. They also have the highest percentage of women pilots and airport managers worldwide. For pilots, it is 18% for IndiGo, while the global average is just 4%!
This is a problem that even we face in our business, especially in tech, product, and leadership roles.</description></item><item><title>Helping nurture the next generation of Indian athletes</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/helping-nurture-the-next-generation-of-indian-athletes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/helping-nurture-the-next-generation-of-indian-athletes/</guid><description>I think one of the easiest ways to be healthy is to pick up a sport you like. The one thing that helps people pick up a sport is seeing someone inspiring. Imagine how many Indians play cricket because of Sachin, etc.
Sadly, while there are countless talented athletes in India, not all of them have the resources and ongoing support to make India proud. Is there something that we can do to support more young athletes is something we had been asking ourselves at @Rainmatterin health.</description></item><item><title>Rainmatter investment in SundayGrids</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-sundaygrids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-sundaygrids/</guid><description>Today, if you are interested in installing some solar panels but don&amp;rsquo;t have the roof space necessary because you live in an apartment or a rented house, there&amp;rsquo;s no solution. Despite the subsidies, only about 10% of urban households have rooftop solar. That means many people are conscious about being sustainable but can&amp;rsquo;t do anything. SundayGrids is taking an interesting approach to solve this problem. They setup solar power plants in other locations and allow people to reserve a part of the capacity in the plant.</description></item><item><title>Rainmatter investment in Solinas</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-solinas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-investment-in-solinas/</guid><description>This is how we get our drinking water. üò¨
These clips were captured by robots built by @solinas_in. These robots go inside water lines to spot leakages, contamination, and other issues, which is impossible to do humanly.

Of course, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean, you can replace steel with bamboo, but a lot of use cases open up where you can reduce the use of steel and augment it with bamboo.</description></item><item><title>Boson White Water with its wastewater solutions</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/boson-white-water-with-its-wastewater-solutions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/boson-white-water-with-its-wastewater-solutions/</guid><description>It just took one bad rainy season for Bengaluru to face a massive water shortage crisis. Given that extreme weather conditions will only become more common, this probably won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time we face this crisis.
I learned recently that wastewater could be part of the solution. Bengaluru&amp;rsquo;s total freshwater demand is ~2632 (million litres a day) MLD, and it generates ~2000 MLD of wastewater. Of this, centralized sewage treatment plants treat ~1,300 MLD, and this water is used for agricultural purposes.</description></item><item><title>A few thoughts on this National Startup Day</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-this-national-startup-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-this-national-startup-day/</guid><description>Today is National Startup Day, which was started in 2016 to highlight the contribution of startups to India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth.
We&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way as a country in recognizing and celebrating the success and contribution of entrepreneurs who, in turn, have inspired more people to startup. For a long time, almost everyone in my life told me to get a real job when I was trading and running a business until Zerodha became popular.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Fittr</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-fittr/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-fittr/</guid><description>When a popular coffee chain started displaying that their large milkshake had a whopping 1000 calories, I thought the sales would drop off a cliff, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t budge. This is maybe an indication of a low understanding of things that can affect people‚Äôs health.
Through Rainmatter Health, we have been looking to support people helping Indians make healthier choices. We are super excited to partner with FITTR as they attempt to solve this challenge from multiple angles:</description></item><item><title>The Otherside podcast with Rohan Bopanna</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-otherside-podcast-with-rohan-bopanna/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-otherside-podcast-with-rohan-bopanna/</guid><description>Playing a sport you enjoy is one of the most accessible ways to be physically and mentally fit. Doing well in sports is also a great way to build on national identity and pride. If more Indians have to play a sport &amp;amp; be healthier, maybe those who have played sports at the highest levels are best placed to popularize sports.
It is fantastic to see sportsmen like Rohan Bopanna sponsoring other athletes, running academies and investing in sports businesses.</description></item><item><title>Benefits of playing a sport</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/benefits-of-playing-a-sport/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/benefits-of-playing-a-sport/</guid><description>The one thing that has helped me remain sane and deal with the volatility of life is playing a sport regularly. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t just helped me reduce stress and anxiety, but I think it has also improved my cognitive abilities. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m almost forced to make healthier lifestyle choices when playing a sport regularly.
Given the benefits of playing a sport, picking up one If you can is a no-brainer, especially for kids.</description></item><item><title>Rainmatter ‚Äì Perennial investments</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-perennial-investments/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rainmatter-perennial-investments/</guid><description>We started Rainmatter in 2016 to support fintech startups working on helping people do better with their money. So far, we have invested ~ Rs 400 crores in 80 startups. In this journey, we realized that having patient Indian investors backing Indian founders is helpful. We&amp;rsquo;re now allocating Rs 1000 crores more to back entrepreneurs building for India.
Good businesses cannot be built overnight, something we learned in our journey. So we are perennial investors and stick with the founders for as long as it takes the founders to build a sustainable business.</description></item><item><title>The importance of long-term support for philanthropy in the social sector</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-long-term-support-for-philanthropy-in-the-social-sector/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-importance-of-long-term-support-for-philanthropy-in-the-social-sector/</guid><description>As part of Rainmatter, I get to be in meetings &amp;amp; learn from the smartest people in the social sector, like #ClimateRISE today. The thing I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand is why Philanthropy/CSR is oriented toward funding projects &amp;amp; not supporting organizations over the long-term.
In both profit and non-profit organizations, the odds of creating returns or impact are highest when you find the right founders and give them enough runway to experiment.</description></item><item><title>Using stock market data feeds in gaming apps</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/using-stock-market-data-feeds-in-gaming-apps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/using-stock-market-data-feeds-in-gaming-apps/</guid><description>Today, YourStory shared that NSE issued a cease and desist letter to all stock gaming apps. We had written about this issue on the Rainmatter blog that using exchange data feeds for gaming involving money is an issue, since regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow it.
When regulations aren&amp;rsquo;t explicit or clear, it&amp;rsquo;s always better to do things in a regulatorily appropriate way, or always better to assume that you are regulated and do things that regulators would expect.</description></item><item><title>Is fractional share investing possible in India?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/is-fractional-investing-possible-in-india/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/is-fractional-investing-possible-in-india/</guid><description>Fractional investing or the ability to invest say $10 in Amazon at $3200 has been the biggest reason for stock market participation to go up in the US. We applied under SEBI regulatory sandbox to launch the same in India. Our learnings by Somnath Mukherjee.

The issue is that most don‚Äôt understand why they need insurance. Even if they do, it&amp;rsquo;s tough to find unbiased advice. There&amp;rsquo;s just too much choice, complexity, mis-selling, &amp;amp; not to mention spam. Scares away most people.

I think so. Money is like a river, it flows where the conditions are conducive to its flow.
The Govt capping the surcharge on LTCG when investing in unlisted companies to encourage investments in startups in the budget is a welcome move. But maybe the tax arbitrage shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so large that everyone just focuses on valuations and not on profits &amp;amp; sustainability.</description></item><item><title>Adoption of organic farming</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/organic-farming/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/organic-farming/</guid><description>I keep asking everyone who‚Äôs adopted organic farming if yields drop after they stopped using chemicals.
