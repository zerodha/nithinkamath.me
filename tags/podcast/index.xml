Doing well in sports is also a great way to build on national identity and pride. If more Indians have to play a sport &amp;amp; be healthier, maybe those who have played sports at the highest levels are best placed to popularize sports.
It is fantastic to see sportsmen like Rohan Bopanna sponsoring other athletes, running academies and investing in sports businesses.</description></item></channel></rss>
