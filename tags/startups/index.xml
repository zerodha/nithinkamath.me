When we started Zerodha in 2010, &amp;ldquo;VC&amp;rdquo; was an exotic term, and there was barely any startup activity. The most popular VCs were dads, uncles and aunts.
Starting around 2010, we began seeing interest driven by India&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;opportunity size.&amp;rdquo; India&amp;rsquo;s population has done more to attract VC money than anything else üòõ &amp;ldquo;India has 120 crore people, and even if 1% buy X&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>Backing The Good Doll - old-school rag dolls stitched by rural women artisans</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/backing-the-good-doll-old-school-rag-dolls-stitched-by-rural-women-artisans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/backing-the-good-doll-old-school-rag-dolls-stitched-by-rural-women-artisans/</guid><description>Three years ago, I came across a post from Suhas &amp;amp; Sunita. They had left their jobs, moved to the Nilgiris, and were working with rural women to build livelihoods through craft. We called up and offered to help. Back then, it was called Indian Yards.
Since then, they‚Äôve pivoted to The good doll and are bringing back old-school rag dolls. The best part is that these dolls are sustainable and stitched by rural women artisans who now earn an income working from their homes, balancing family and livelihood.</description></item><item><title>SCRA rules clarified</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/scra-rules-clarified/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/scra-rules-clarified/</guid><description>Finally, after clarification of SCRA rules by Ministry of Finance and NSE, brokers can now invest their own funds without exchange approvals or restrictions.
This is huge for Rainmatter.

The last few years of partnering Amwoodo and Agni Mitra have been special. And yeah, the business is for profit and quite profitable.
I really hope these numbers keep increasing as the business grows and has to deal with other pressures and competing priorities.</description></item><item><title>What‚Äôs the secret to startup success?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/whats-the-secret-to-startup-success/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/whats-the-secret-to-startup-success/</guid><description>What is critical for the success of a startup - founders&amp;rsquo; skills or the macros?
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of both. You could be a great founder with excellent execution skills but still struggle in an unfavorable macro environment. Or, you could be an average founder benefiting from the economic momentum of your country and sector.
Every time I think about this, I realize how fortunate we have been in terms of macros, both as a country and through government initiatives.</description></item><item><title>Corporate growth could be hitting a plateau</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/corporate-growth-could-be-hitting-a-plateau/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/corporate-growth-could-be-hitting-a-plateau/</guid><description>Corporate growth, in both the public and private markets, seems to be plateauing across most sectors. Even in the private markets, in most cases, valuations in the earlier funding rounds were already far over the fundamental value or expected growth of startups, which is why there&amp;rsquo;s hardly any news about funding for later-stage startups.

It&amp;rsquo;s a matter of pride that we have many amazing homegrown space startups, like @AgnikulCosmos and @GalaxEye, both from the @Rainmatterin portfolio.
Agnikul recently tested the world‚Äôs first 3D-printed rocket engine and is aiming to launch a satellite by 2025.
Considering the cutting-edge research and technology needed, spacetech startups, more than other startups, need patient capital. So here&amp;rsquo;s hoping we&amp;rsquo;ll have more homegrown spacetech startups that will make us proud.</description></item><item><title>Startup Mahakumbh</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/startup-mahakumbh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/startup-mahakumbh/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to see the Indian startup ecosystem go from strength to strength.

Today, much of the success of homegrown startups goes to investors outside India.
Staying in India and incorporating at home also saves the future hassle of paying huge taxes to flip back. Also, the growing local pools of capital, ever-improving regulations, and the growth of IPO markets have made India a much more attractive destination than it ever was.</description></item><item><title>A few thoughts on this National Startup Day</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-this-national-startup-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-this-national-startup-day/</guid><description>Today is National Startup Day, which was started in 2016 to highlight the contribution of startups to India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth.
We&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way as a country in recognizing and celebrating the success and contribution of entrepreneurs who, in turn, have inspired more people to startup. For a long time, almost everyone in my life told me to get a real job when I was trading and running a business until Zerodha became popular.</description></item><item><title>Rethinking Investment Strategies for startups and joining the NSAC</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rethinking-investment-strategies-for-startups-and-joining-the-nsac/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rethinking-investment-strategies-for-startups-and-joining-the-nsac/</guid><description>More Indians today than ever before are aspiring to be entrepreneurs thanks to Government initiatives &amp;amp; messaging, the media coverage of the startup ecosystem, founder success stories, &amp;amp; more.
The one thing we need to work on as a nation is to unlock domestic capital for startups/MSMEs. Reduce the dependence on foreign capital and get Indians to back Indian startups.
It is maybe time for newer products or vehicles that can be used by accredited investors or those who can take higher risks to be able to invest in equity or debt in startups/MSMEs.</description></item><item><title>Indian startups will do well despite the negativity</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indian-startups-will-do-well-despite-the-negativity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indian-startups-will-do-well-despite-the-negativity/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Investment is the discipline of relative selection‚Äù - Sid Cottle.
Indian startups will most likely continue to attract foreign capital even if all the news might make it seem otherwise. This is mainly because we are the fastest-growing country in the world, and investing is about selecting the best from all the existing options. It is a relative decision, and global investors have to invest.
By the way, anecdotally talking to some international investors, Indian startups seem to be faring better in the last year or so, where the focus has been more on reducing burn &amp;amp; getting on the path to profitability.</description></item><item><title>Empowering women to join the workforce is the easiest way to increase economic growth</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/empowering-women-to-join-the-workforce-is-the-easiest-way-to-increase-economic-growth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/empowering-women-to-join-the-workforce-is-the-easiest-way-to-increase-economic-growth/</guid><description>Empowering women to join the workforce is an obvious way to increase our economic growth. Our female labor force participation rate is among the lowest in the world. One thing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense of is why our female labor force participation (FLFP), which was in the ~30% range in the 90s, fell to 20% and rose to 24%. We have been discussing this topic on the Rainmatter Grove and and Ashutosh from IndiaDataHub shared something interesting:</description></item><item><title>You need both physical and digital presence to reach more customers in India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/you-need-both-physical-and-digital-presence-to-reach-more-customers-in-india/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/you-need-both-physical-and-digital-presence-to-reach-more-customers-in-india/</guid><description>HDFC Bank opening 4 new branches daily last year is phenomenal.
As counterintuitive as it sounds, I think the real competition for most Fintechs in India is the branches of all banks. Each bank branch sells everything from loans, investments, insurance, and more.
Other than small-value consumer loans &amp;amp; payments, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is possible to expand the market or increase market share beyond a certain point by being digital only.</description></item><item><title>India is many countries in one</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-is-many-countries-in-one/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-is-many-countries-in-one/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;India has 140 crore people, and if X% can become customers because of Y% in a developed country,&amp;rdquo; is a dangerous line of thinking for founders and investors.
While building for up to 3% of English-speaking affluent Indians is easier, it&amp;rsquo;s much harder and complex beyond that. Something we are pondering at Zerodha as well.
I guess the right way to think of this is, India is many countries in one.</description></item><item><title>Encouraging wealthy Indian investors to invest in Indian entrepreneurs</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/encouraging-wealthy-indian-investors-to-invest-in-indian-entrepreneurs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/encouraging-wealthy-indian-investors-to-invest-in-indian-entrepreneurs/</guid><description>UK offers 50% tax relief &amp;amp; capital gains exemption for startup investments. This seems a great way to incentivize wealthy to invest in startups. We maybe need similar schemes to reduce our dependency on foreign VCs &amp;amp; better use our local wealth stuck in Gold, Real estate &amp;amp; FDs.
The biggest problem to solve in India is to spread wealth inclusively &amp;amp; not just in the top 1%.
This is possible only when wealth creation can be captured by a large subset of Indians when Indian businesses do well.</description></item><item><title>Significance of MSMEs</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-significance-of-msmes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-significance-of-msmes/</guid><description>I was at an amazing Micro, Small, &amp;amp; Medium enterprises (MSME) event hosted by Rajiv Talreja. One lesson I had to share. Today&amp;rsquo;s world is about the fast beating the slow, not the big beating the small like in the past. So being small &amp;amp; hence fast is an edge, not a disadvantage.
While Zerodha might seem large, we are still an MSME at heart. MSMEs today face many challenges like access to capital, credit etc.</description></item><item><title>Potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on mankind and capitalism.</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/potential-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-mankind-and-capitalism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/potential-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-mankind-and-capitalism/</guid><description>It took us ~30 mins to integrate commoditized ChatGPT, see tangible benefits, and realize that more than 20% of jobs could be automated.

This is because of liquidation preferences &amp;amp; the disconnect between valuations and business fundamentals.
A liquidation preference allows investors to recover their investment before anyone else. This is how all startups raise money. Nobody thinks of it as a loan, but it is similar. The more money founders raise, the harder it is for them and their teams to see equity upside.</description></item><item><title>The best example of an Indian fintech product made for India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-best-example-of-an-indian-fintech-product-made-for-india/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-best-example-of-an-indian-fintech-product-made-for-india/</guid><description>India is unique.
