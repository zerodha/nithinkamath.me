This applies even if the broker is registered as a research analyst. However, despite yesterday&amp;rsquo;s circular, brokers&amp;rsquo; parent companies are allowed to create a &amp;ldquo;super-app&amp;rdquo; where broking and lending happens side-by-side. This is permissible today because there are no restrictions on the parent entity.
The core concern is that any type of lending or inducement to borrow on a trading platform could lead to borrowed money flowing back into the markets.</description></item><item><title>Why we don't provide personal and credit card loans through Zerodha Capital</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-we-dont-provide-personal-and-credit-card-loans-through-zerodha-capital/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-we-dont-provide-personal-and-credit-card-loans-through-zerodha-capital/</guid><description>Someone on our team recently asked, &amp;ldquo;Why do we only offer Loan Against Securities on Zerodha Capital?&amp;rdquo; Why not personal loans or credit cards with their higher interest rates?
The simple answer is we can&amp;rsquo;t do anything different there. And our cost of funds doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. We&amp;rsquo;re at ~8.5%, while banks raise money at ~3.5%, and large NBFCs around ~7%.
Can&amp;rsquo;t compete on rates, and usually the best borrowers go where the rates are the lowest.</description></item><item><title>Check your credit rating on Zerodha Capital</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/check-your-credit-rating-on-zerodha-capital/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/check-your-credit-rating-on-zerodha-capital/</guid><description>I did a credit check on Zerodha Capital to check out the flow, and my score is 747.
