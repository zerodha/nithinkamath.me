The last few years of partnering Amwoodo and Agni Mitra have been special. And yeah, the business is for profit and quite profitable.
I really hope these numbers keep increasing as the business grows and has to deal with other pressures and competing priorities.</description></item><item><title>Turning Lantana’s destruction into opportunity</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/turning-lantanas-estruction-into-opportunity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/turning-lantanas-estruction-into-opportunity/</guid><description>If you grew up in the rural parts of India or even spent some time there, you would have probably seen a Lantana plant and its colourful flowers.
