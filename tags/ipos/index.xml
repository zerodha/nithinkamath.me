I had tweeted this in 2019 when we had very few aspirational brands worth investing in. But since then, it&amp;rsquo;s crazy how much the Indian markets have changed in terms of the companies, the investor base, etc.
I hope we see more homegrown brands IPO in the coming years.</description></item><item><title>Advancements in capital market regulations</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/advancements-in-capital-market-regulations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/advancements-in-capital-market-regulations/</guid><description>After a long time, we have had massive activity in the IPO market, with Rs 2.6lk cr blocked in bank accounts for IPOs worth Rs 7.6k cr.
If this was 2003, it would take 16 working days (or ~1 month), and the entire money would have moved to investment bankers and cost investors (an interest forego) at least 0.5% (assuming 6% pa) or Rs 1300 crores.
T+16 became T+12, T+6, and from Sep 2023 it is T+3 (~1week).</description></item></channel></rss>
