Money management, which most don&amp;rsquo;t focus on, is exponentially more important than buy/sell signals &amp;amp; strategies.
In the last 20yrs, I haven’t seen anyone who has kept profits from trading without good risk management. I know many who&amp;rsquo;ve lost quickly. The fastest was a client, who turned Rs 1lk to Rs 2 cr in 2 days buying deep OTM puts in 2008 but gave it all back in the next 12 months.</description></item><item><title>Unauthorised CFD and forex trading platforms</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/unauthorised-cfd-and-forex-trading-platforms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/unauthorised-cfd-and-forex-trading-platforms/</guid><description>We had cautioned people about illegal CFD &amp;amp; Forex &amp;amp; Binary trading platforms a while back, but I still keep seeing those ads, which means people still losing money.

Trading activity was mostly in futures until 2008. Options only became popular once contract sizes &amp;amp; margins went up. A brief history of F&amp;amp;O margins.
A key impetus for us starting Zerodha in 2010 was that there were discussions in the markets on SEBI introducing margin reporting and short margin penalty for not collecting sufficient margins for overnight F&amp;amp;O positions after the market collapse in 2008.</description></item><item><title>Irresponsible influencers</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/influencers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/influencers/</guid><description>Watching famous personalities with huge fan followings trying to trigger their fans or retail investors to invest in super risky asset classes without talking about the risks, or caring about the risk profile of those who follow them is quite disgusting.

While an algo doesn&amp;rsquo;t have emotions, it is only as good as the person who wrote it or controls (start &amp;amp; stop) it—the same person who&amp;rsquo;s riddled with fear and greed.
Every algo like any trader, strategy or stock, has ups &amp;amp; downs. Just like impatient discretionary traders constantly try to time entry &amp;amp; exit, getting in late &amp;amp; out early, trade against trends, the same happens with algo traders trying to constantly find the best algo as well.</description></item><item><title>Illiquidity premium</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/illquidity-and-the-temptation-of-selling-quick/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/illquidity-and-the-temptation-of-selling-quick/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve asked a lot of successful MF, PE &amp;amp; VC managers if they would be able to resist the temptation to time the market and hold on to profitable investments if they could easily exit &amp;amp; enter investments like retail investors.

Yes, when you buy options the max you can lose is the premium you have paid. But to get a sense of risk and how fast or easily you can lose, you should look at the exposure or contract value, not the premium.
For eg, you have Rs 1L &amp;amp; you use it to buy 20 lots of Nifty calls = Rs 1.</description></item><item><title>Option buying - The riskiest trade</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/options-buying-the-riskiest-trade/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/options-buying-the-riskiest-trade/</guid><description>~80% of all open buy option positions at the end of every day are in losses.

If you add impact costs, the minimum return an active trader should generate to break even yearly on their portfolio is usually well above 20%. Yep, that high and that tough.
Costs include Statutory costs like STT, Stamp duty, GST Impact costs or slippages (while this doesn’t even seem like a cost, it adds up quickly.</description></item><item><title>Introducing kill switch</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-kill-switch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-kill-switch/</guid><description>When you&amp;rsquo;re in a drawdown while trading, the best thing to do is to take a break.

You can&amp;rsquo;t become a better trader if you don&amp;rsquo;t learn from your mistakes. But in order to learn, you need a proper journal of all your trades and the reasons you took the trades.

We&amp;rsquo;ll see a drop in trading volumes and an increase in impact cost. But in the long term, more traders will survive &amp;amp; hopefully make up for the dip.
There is an argument to be made for lesser intraday margins. VAR+ELM or SPAN+Exposure margin calculation is based on risk/volatility. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between intraday &amp;amp; overnight risk, or that intraday is less risky and hence ideally requires lesser margins.</description></item><item><title>Trading with other people’s money</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-with-other-peoples-money/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-with-other-peoples-money/</guid><description>Managing other people&amp;rsquo;s money in ways that aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed leads to the most complaints with the regulators.
