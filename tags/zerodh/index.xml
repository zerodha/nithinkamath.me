Hopefully, this makes loan against securities (LAS) more popular.
It’s ridiculous how many people holding stocks continue taking personal loans or using credit cards at much higher rates—credit cards can go up to 40%+. Even at Zerodha Capital, we see this constantly. People just aren’t aware they can replace high-interest debt with LAS, which is one reason our book is still only ₹450 crores.</description></item></channel></rss>
