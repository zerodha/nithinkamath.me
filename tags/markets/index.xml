Since the time leverage restrictions were introduced, intraday equity volumes have stagnated, despite the mother of all bull runs. Apart from leverage, the fact that securities Transaction Tax (STT) is higher for intraday equity and futures compared to options has also hurt the volumes. The hope is STT on intraday equity and futures will reduce some day. üò¨
Intraday equity trading turnover is important because it significantly reduces the impact cost for those making equity delivery trades.</description></item><item><title>Zerodha's remarkable market growth post COVID</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodhas-remarkable-market-growth-post-covid/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodhas-remarkable-market-growth-post-covid/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s unreal how much our markets have expanded post-COVID.

All this growth has come post-pandemic.
This chart from @theeconomist shows how Indian markets have grown. Here are a few data points.
Indian household assets.
NSE has 9 crore unique PANs, which is a reasonable estimate of total unique investors. We have about 4.39 crore unique mutual fund investors.

Symbolism to indicate that over 50% of all retail trades in India, in a way, originate from Bengaluru, either from brokers or their tech teams based out of here.

Much of this growth has come in the last 3‚Äì4 years. The pace of financialization is crazy, and this is in no small part thanks to the exchanges, especially NSE. This is vital for India to grow.

Active clients on NSE, Google &amp;amp; social media trends are way below all-time highs. Unlikely that activity will pick up given the higher interest rate environment.
I keep telling our team that our competition is really the bank&amp;rsquo;s fixed-deposit rates, not our peers.

It is a must-watch for anyone who takes an interest in the industry.
Here is how I think the outcome of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s meet will affect retail brokerage firms.
The biggest risk for almost all regulated businesses in India is regulatory change.

The 25% increase in F&amp;amp;O STT will further move volumes from futures to options. The actual impact wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much because over 80% of the volumes come from options &amp;amp; STT is on premium, not on contract value as it is in futures.
It is good that the impact will not be as much on options. But a vibrant capital market needs activity across futures and options.</description></item><item><title>The case for payments banks</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-case-for-payments-banks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-case-for-payments-banks/</guid><description>With the SVB crisis, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of talk in the US about the need for a bank that holds money in government bonds without taking risks. Just a simple wallet where people keep their cash, earn a reasonable interest, &amp;amp; make payments. What RBI intended with payments banks.
Payments bank didn&amp;rsquo;t pick up in India because users didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pay monthly fees.

But just looking at volumes &amp;amp; not unique users can be misleading.
Jump in options last 2 yrs is mostly due to intraday stock traders switching to options after intraday leverage restrictions in early 2021
~10% of active traders contribute ~90% of trading volumes, in mostly intraday cash and F&amp;amp;O.
Comparing trading volumes of traders to equity investors is like comparing apples to oranges or brinjals.</description></item><item><title>The impact of extended trading hours on traders and markets</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-impact-of-extended-trading-hours-on-traders-and-markets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-impact-of-extended-trading-hours-on-traders-and-markets/</guid><description>Extended trading hours for F&amp;amp;O will maybe signal the maturity of our markets. They also level the playing field for domestic traders against international traders and are also good for capital markets businesses in terms of revenues, but I&amp;rsquo;m conflicted.
I&amp;rsquo;m unsure how it will affect the mental health of active retail F&amp;amp;O traders in the long term. Tracking P&amp;amp;L for long hours is stressful &amp;amp; can affect life outside trading.</description></item><item><title>Adverse impact of budget on international investing platforms</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/adverse-impact-of-the-budget-on-international-investing-platforms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/adverse-impact-of-the-budget-on-international-investing-platforms/</guid><description>For retail investors, I guess the only material change in the budget is for people who invest in international stocks. Money sent out using LRS now has a Tax Collection at Source (TCS) of 20% with no upper or lower threshold, compared to 5% over Rs 7lks earlier.
TCS can be claimed after filing income tax returns at the end of the year, but it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that many will be okay with having 20% of capital blocked until then.</description></item><item><title>Making auction markets accessible to retail investors</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/making-auction-markets-accessible-to-retail-investors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/making-auction-markets-accessible-to-retail-investors/</guid><description>If you actively trade, you would&amp;rsquo;ve faced a short delivery and a large auction penalty at least once.

I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I think, if anything, brokerage rates will go up in the future. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
Firstly, in the US, brokers can earn in ways that SEBI rightly doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow here: Payment for order flow: selling customer orders to HFT firms. Securities lending: Unlike India, stocks are held in the street name or in the name of brokers‚Äîthey can lend them to earn.</description></item><item><title>Impact of 1% TDS on all Crypto trades</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-1-percent-tds-on-all-crypto-trades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-1-percent-tds-on-all-crypto-trades/</guid><description>They say the devil is in the details.

Lower txn costs improve liquidity, hence decrease impact costs.

Averaging down or buying more of an asset, be it stock or crypto, as the price keeps going down and hoping that the price bounces to recover losses or make profits faster. Common behaviour among retail investors.
While it is tempting to average down, the odds of this strategy working are significantly low in the long run.

With Crypto exchanges offering 10 to 100x leverage (futures), on days like today, I wonder who monitors liquidity position of these platforms.
In regulated space, even with all checks &amp;amp; balances, brokerage firms once in a while on days of extreme volatility go bust.

There is an argument to be made for lesser intraday margins. VAR+ELM or SPAN+Exposure margin calculation is based on risk/volatility.
