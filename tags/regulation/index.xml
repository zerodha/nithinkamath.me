My understanding of it is it should be ok for savvy traders using APIs for individual trading with some reasonable order limits. But the APIs have to be accessed through only static IPs, but this isn’t hard to get.
But platforms that offer algos or readymade strategies will need to get them approved through the broker. The broker, in turn, has to register all algos and strategies with the exchanges.</description></item><item><title>SEBI reasserts regulations on unlisted shares</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebi-reasserts-regulations-on-unlisted-shares/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebi-reasserts-regulations-on-unlisted-shares/</guid><description>Allowing transactions in unlisted shares is a violation of SEBI regulations.

Having said that, I am part of various committees, and what has always amazed me is the consultative approach that SEBI has taken over the years. No regulation is passed without hearing from the industry and other experts. This shows in the fact that today, our capital markets are among the safest in the world, if not the safest.</description></item><item><title>Rise in options trading and the regulatory risks</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rise-in-options-trading-and-the-regulatory-risks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rise-in-options-trading-and-the-regulatory-risks/</guid><description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve said before, regulatory risk is the biggest risk for any regulated business.
We are in the middle of a period of excess in options trading. Volumes in index options have gone up from 4.6 lk cr in 2018 to 138 lk cr in 2024, and, more importantly, the share of retail has gone up from 2% to 41%.
We have been a big beneficiary of this jump in volume but have always been aware that it can be significantly reduced in size due to regulations, which can significantly hurt revenues, and that&amp;rsquo;s also why we have never made any forward projections.</description></item><item><title>SEBI’s new regulations on direct securities transfer and increased BSDA limits</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-new-regulations-on-direct-securities-transfer-and-increased-bsda-limits/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebis-new-regulations-on-direct-securities-transfer-and-increased-bsda-limits/</guid><description>Since 2019, SEBI has brought in several changes that have made our markets safer and more investor-friendly. It started with segregation of client funds, compulsory quarterly bank runs on brokers (quarterly settlement), removing pooling of funds for MF transactions, and more.
The latest regulation is around the direct payout of securities to investor demat accounts upon purchase. Today, when investors buy securities, they&amp;rsquo;re credited by the clearing corporation to the stock broker&amp;rsquo;s pool account, who in turn transfers them to the clients.</description></item><item><title>SEBI circular on sharing realtime price data with third parties</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebi-circular-on-sharing-realtime-price-data-with-third-parties/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/sebi-circular-on-sharing-realtime-price-data-with-third-parties/</guid><description>Sebi&amp;rsquo;s circular essentially means that it ends all platforms offering trading competition, demo trading, CFDs, and more.

This is a great move that can help attract retail participation in the bonds. With all the changes in the last few years, SEBI has done an amazing job of making bonds accessible to small investors.

The RBI has its own reasons for restricting unhedged currency derivatives, but this means the death of currency derivative trading on stock exchanges by retail traders.

You might have seen advertisements for these platforms on YouTube and other social media platforms.
These platforms blatantly sell greed and offer insane leverage (~100X) to attract users. Not only are these platforms illegally operating in India, but they are also incredibly scammy. Even if you unknowingly put some money in, they make it incredibly hard to withdraw.</description></item><item><title>A few things I learned about food and sustainability</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-need-to-protect-net-neutrality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-need-to-protect-net-neutrality/</guid><description>Recently, there have been talks of revisiting the idea of net neutrality in India.

The exponential growth of our technology and startup ecosystem would not have been possible without this. Without net-neutrality, there perhaps would not have been a Zerodha.</description></item><item><title>Stock market prediction gaming platforms are regulatorily grey</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/stock-market-prediction-gaming-platforms-are-regulatorily-grey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/stock-market-prediction-gaming-platforms-are-regulatorily-grey/</guid><description>Stock market prediction gaming platforms where you guess the direction of stocks and indices for rewards is a regulatorily grey business model, to say the least.
NSE has always been clear that any market data (bid, ask, LTP, etc.) can only be used by the customers of a brokerage firm for trading purposes. Exchanges have IP over this data. Globally, revenues from data feeds are more than transaction fee revenues for exchanges.</description></item><item><title>The twisted world of illegal CFDs &amp; binary options</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-twisted-world-of-illegal-cfds-binary-options/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-twisted-world-of-illegal-cfds-binary-options/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Evolution of the Indian stock broking industry since the Harshad Mehta scam - Scam92 TV Show</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/evolution-of-the-indian-stock-broking-industry-the/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/evolution-of-the-indian-stock-broking-industry-the/</guid><description>#Scam1992TheHarshadMehtaStory - a thread on everything that has changed since then in the world of Indian stockbroking.
