We at Zerodha , have ~40k NRI customers with an average account value of ₹40L, nearly 10x our overall average of ₹3.6L for resident accounts. Most of them opened accounts the hard way, with physical paperwork. If onboarding were fully online, this base would be much larger.

SEBI recently made changes that have allowed us to significantly simplify Non-PIS NRI accounts: they now work like resident accounts, with fully online Aadhaar-based onboarding (when visiting India) and intraday, BTST, and F&O access with no need for a CP code. We’ve also reduced the brokerage from ₹100 to ₹50 per order.

For context: NRIs can open NRO (without PIS) or NRE accounts to invest in India. NRE accounts allow repatriation of funds to your country of residence, but are more complex to operate. NRO (Non-PIS) accounts are simpler to open and operate, though repatriation is capped at USD 1 million per year.

Hoping to see more NRI capital flowing back into Indian businesses. More [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8yOc9-oA3I)
