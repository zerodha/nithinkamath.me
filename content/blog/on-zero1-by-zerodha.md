We started the [Zero1](https://x.com/Zero1ByZerodha) network to collaborate with people to create high-quality content and support them so they can focus on content. 

This, as seen in this pic, taken at the [Zero1](https://x.com/Zero1ByZerodha) fest, is turning into quite a line-up. ðŸ˜€ 

And the fest was incredible! Thanks to [Prateek Singh](https://x.com/PrateekLearnapp), [Under 25 Universe](https://x.com/under25universe), [Sagar Gudekote](https://x.com/SagarHerodha), and the rest of the team.

The panel with [Nikhil](https://x.com/nikhilkamathcio) and [Kunal Shah](https://x.com/kunalb11), where Nik, as usual, changed the format on the stage and amongst everything else, we spoke about what we don't like about each other. ðŸ˜¬
