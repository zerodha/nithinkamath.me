description: Holding shares in demat form...

---
We often hear stories from investors, on social media and in real life, about holding physical share certificates; even discovering ones that belonged to their parents or grandparents.

Today, SEBI no longer permits the transfer of physical shares, except in specific cases like inheritance. So, holding shares in demat form isn’t just more convenient and secure, it’s essential if you want to do anything with them.

We see this as a real issue and want to help. We've set up a dedicated team to assist with the dematerialisation process. You don’t need to be a Zerodha customer or even have an account with us; we’ll still help you conveet your physical shares to demat. If you're unsure how to start, just [raise a ticket below](https://zerodha.com/dematerialise/)
