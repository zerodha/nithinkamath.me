In some exciting news, [@zerodhavarsity's](https://x.com/ZerodhaVarsity) personal finance course is now available on the IGOT ([@iGOTKarmayogi](https://x.com/iGOTKarmayogi) portal for government employees. It's easy to think that most people should and will know the importance of saving, having an emergency fund, health insurance, long-term investing, etc., but that's not the case. I'm hoping as many people as possible watch this and learn the basics. By the way, this is available on the Varsity website and YouTube channel as well.

Here are the links: [Varsity](https://www.youtube.com/@varsitybyzerodha/playlists), [Karmayogi portal](https://portal.igotkarmayogi.gov.in/app/toc/do_1141999407663022081143/overview).
