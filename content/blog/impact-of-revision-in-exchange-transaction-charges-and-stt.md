quity delivery will continue to be free at [@zerodhaonline](https://x.com/zerodhaonline). As of now, we are not making any changes to our brokerage.

From today, Oct 1, 2024,

For options: STT increases to 0.1% from 0.0625%, and transaction charge decreases to 0.035% from 0.0495%.

This results in the cost of trades seeing a net increase of 0.02303% or Rs 2303 per crore of premium on the selling side on NSE and of 0.0205% or Rs 2050 per crore on BSE.

For futures: STT increases to 0.02% from 0.0125%, and transaction charge decreases to 0.00173% from 0.00183%.

This results in a net increase of 0.00735% or Rs 735 per crore of futures turnover on the selling side.

You can check out our brokerage calculator to see the new charges.

Since STT is charged on the entire contract value for futures, whereas in options, it is charged only on the premium, the impact will be much larger for futures traders.
