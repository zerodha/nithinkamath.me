description: India is more like a continent...

---

I recently returned from visiting several countries in Europe. Everything feels like a cut, copy, and paste with very small differences.

In contrast, India is more like a continent than a country. The diversity in terms of languages, food, culture, etc., between the 28 states and within each state is nuts.

Every time I think of this, I am amazed at how the country actually came together.
