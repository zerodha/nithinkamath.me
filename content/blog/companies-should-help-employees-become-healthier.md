We came first in the corporate team category at the half at [IRONMAN Triathlon](https://twitter.com/IRONMANtri) in Goa today. [Dilip](https://twitter.com/kmr_dilip) running the half marathon, [Vishnu](https://twitter.com/vishnus)cycling 90km, and me swimming 1.9km. 

Ridiculous that we came first with a total time of whopping 6.2 hours. ðŸ˜¬ An indicator of how maybe more needs to be done at corporates in India to focus on health and fitness, and participating in events like this is a good nudge. 

We had 3 teams from Zerodha,[Rainmatter](https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin) and [Rainmatter Foundation](https://twitter.com/RainmatterOrg)
