I think we've finally found a way to teach finance and markets online with both quality and scale with [Varsity Live.](https://varsitylive.zerodha.com/home)

We've had 2.3 lakh registrations so far, with about 3,000 new people signing up every week. By the way, this Sunday, the 23rd, we're hosting a finance boot camp for kids. Most of this is a result of people discovering Varsity Live and sharing it with their friends and family.

For almost 12 years now, since we started Varsity, we've gotten the same question: what's the agenda? Why no advertising? Why not collect emails and mobile numbers? Why no spam or push notifications nudging people to trade?

We've (most of them by [Karthik Rangappa](https://x.com/karthikrangappa) 😀) answered lakhs of questions over the years—first through the website, then videos, and now live sessions. But the answer to that question has always been simple: to share whatever we know and play our part in spreading financial literacy among Indians.

Plus, we're lucky to be in a position to build all of this without expecting something in return. 🙂
