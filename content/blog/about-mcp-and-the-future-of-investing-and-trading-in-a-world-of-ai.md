I keep asking K about what all this progress in AI means for our business. It feels to me like we're at the very beginning of a massive shift in how financial services will work.

At some point, I think all of it, from investing and trading to banking and payments, will happen through custom AI-powered apps built by users themselves using natural language instructions.

In that world, what's the role of a broker? Likely, we'll just be a set of "pipes" connecting users to exchanges and back-office systems. The interfaces will mostly be built by users themselves. The only way to stay relevant is to ensure we're the best pipe: fast, efficient, reliable, and invisible when it matters.

That's why, over the years, K and the tech team have been obsessively making our systems faster, more scalable, and future-ready. Even if these improvements don't immediately change a customer's trading or reporting experience, we've chosen to fix every possible bottleneck today, not later.

Tools like ChatGPT and Claude make it clear this shift isn't an "if" but a "when." It might take a few years or a decade, but it's inevitable. Human advisors will still have a role, mainly to help people stick to what these tools recommend.

As for how things will evolve, the answer is grey. No one knows. Our approach: stay curious, keep track of the trends, and act where it makes sense. For example, we've intentionally held back on enabling AI-driven order placement.

In a future where everything is automated, trust and infrastructure will be our only real moats.
