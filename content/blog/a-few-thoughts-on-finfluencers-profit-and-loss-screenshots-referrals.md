People have been asking me about Finfluencers, P&L screenshots, and paying brokerage referrals. I shared a few thoughts here. If you have any questions, you can post them on the same [Tradingqna link](https://tradingqna.com/t/fake-pnl-of-live-trading-finfluencers-scam/152081/31), and I'd be happy to answer.
