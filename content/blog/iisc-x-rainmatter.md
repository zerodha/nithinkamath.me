description: Longevity isn’t just about living longer...

---

We recently partnered with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to create India’s first Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) Program for longevity.

Longevity isn’t just about living longer—it’s about living better. This program provides an opportunity for scientists, technologists, and aspiring entrepreneurs to build solutions at the intersection of deep science and technology.

India needs accessible and affordable healthcare solutions, and this program serves as a platform to encourage such innovation. The selected teams will work closely with IISc faculty at [Longevity](https://x.com/LongevityIndia)
 and our team at [Rainmatter](https://x.com/Rainmatterin)
.

India is already the diabetes capital of the world, and we are facing a growing number of other health challenges. The scale and scope of these challenges are such that the government alone won’t be able to solve everything—we’ll need creative solutions from entrepreneurs. This is one reason why we started backing startups working on making Indians healthier through Rainmatter.
