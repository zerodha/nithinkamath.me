All of us at [@zerodhaonline](https://twitter.com/zerodhaonline) went fully remote during the pandemic lockdown in 2020. While it's been great for some, it hasn't been for others. In this post, K explains why it didn't work for everybody at Zerodha. 

Work from home works well for support roles given the structured nature of the work. But for tech, business, and decision making teams, it has been detrimental, primarily due to the big gaps in remote communication.

So about ~10% (100+ people) of the core team started coming to the office 3 days a week starting a few months ago. The change has been dramatically positive to say the least.
