We at [Rainmatter](https://rainmatter.com/) finally met the [Social Alpha](https://x.com/SocialAlphaIN) team, and I am still thinking about everything [Manoj Malgharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkbhatt/) shared.

Set up as a non-profit, they’re solving some of the toughest social, economic, and environmental challenges by bridging the gap between science and society.

What stood out is not just the funding or grants they make, but more importantly, the way they support ideas — from testing in their labs to taking them to market, derisking for scale, and much more.

Hard to think of a better enabler in the Indian startup ecosystem than this.
