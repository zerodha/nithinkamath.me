description:  We've answered a lot of those questions...

A bunch of you asked us questions about our revenues, regulations, international investing, AI, and more. 
[Nikhil](https://x.com/nikhilkamathcio), Kailash, [Karthik Rangappa](https://x.com/karthikrangappa), [Venu](https://x.com/venumadhav_ks), and I answered a lot of those questions in [this AMA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzTWpjAAUe0) 

Since there were several questions about US investing: we didn't offer it until now because the regulations were unclear, but now there's clarity. In May, SEBI and IFSCA allowed brokers to operate in GIFT City, and in June, the exchanges allowed brokers to offer third-party products. So we've started building this offering, and we'll soon launch it.
