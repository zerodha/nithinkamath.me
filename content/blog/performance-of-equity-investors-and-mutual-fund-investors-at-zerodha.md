As strange as it sounds, our equity investors are sitting on higher overall notional gains than equity mutual fund investors. 

Maybe the popular narrative that retail investors are clueless and “gambling” isn’t fully accurate. That’s because you would expect direct equity investors to do worse than mutual fund investors.

Disclaimer: Most of our AUM was added post-2020, which is one of the biggest bull markets India has seen.
