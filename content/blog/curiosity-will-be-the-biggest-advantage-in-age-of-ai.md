A conversation on our internal forum. 

Vignesh:
With AI getting smarter every day, able to handle complex tasks in minutes or even seconds, and turning a comms head Bhuvan into a programmer, what’s the one skill you believe will always remain irreplaceable?

Nithin:
Curiosity.
I think everyone needs the ability to remain curious. In the world of AI, people who are curious will have an advantage. Curious about what? About everything. In terms of work, be curious about other processes or other things people do, be curious to know if you could solve your own or others’ problems, and so on.
Btw, the reason [@bebhuvan](https://x.com/bebhuvan) has turned into an amateur programmer with vibe coding is because he is curious.
