3500+ companies have reported earnings, and there's a broad-based recovery across sectors.

"Aggregate revenues have risen 8.2% year-on-year, while EBITDA and PAT climbed 14.1% and 16.0%, respectively. Excluding Financial Services, profit growth accelerated to 22.5%"

Perhaps this explains why indices are holding up much better than most bears had expected. Hoping this earnings strength sustains 🤞
