Dayum! It's crazy that [@nikhilkamathcio's](https://twitter.com/nikhilkamathcio) podcast is among the top video podcasts globally.

I think the reason people like the show is because Nik does it with the intent to learn and share knowledge. There's no hidden agenda or sales pitch. More importantly, he isn't afraid of saying "I don't know" publicly. Very few people can be like this after being successful professionally.

Of course, it helps that Nik's ability to network and make friends is his superpower. The insecurity of not reading when young has meant overcompensating by reading more later in life. ðŸ˜€This has led to him becoming a good listener and speaker. Being good-looking helps as well, I guess ðŸ˜¬
