Two years ago, we met a group of women in Chikkodi, Belgaum. Many were in debt. Some had never thought about savings or budgeting. We spent 2 days together learning the basics of financial literacy through [Varsity](https://x.com/ZerodhaVarsity) with the help of [Svatah Foundation](https://x.com/teamsvatah) and [Pankh India](https://x.com/TweetPankh).

But instead of stopping there, we kept in touch and continued helping them for 2 years. Today, most of these women are debt-free.
For someone from a low-income background, that's true financial independence.

This is why we do what we do. 😀
