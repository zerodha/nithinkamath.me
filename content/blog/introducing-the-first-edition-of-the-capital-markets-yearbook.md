We started Zerodha in 2010, and in the first decade or so, I kept wondering, "When would the Indian capital markets expand?" and what would the trigger be? My question was answered in 2020, and the trigger was a global pandemic. ðŸ˜¬ In the 5 years since 2020, the Indian markets have grown more than the preceding decade and a half. This growth was across the board, no matter what metric you look at, from unique investors, turnover, new SIPs, IPOs, to liquidity.

In my 14 years of being a stockbroker, I can confidently say that the Indian stock market has never been more mainstream than it is today. There seems to be a transition after 5 years of the bull market but that is to be expected.

Given the transformation of our markets, there was no publication that documented this growth. We asked [Ashutosh Datar](https://x.com/adatar) of 
[India DataHub](https://x.com/IndiaDataHub) if we could create a Yearbook and he said yes. That's how this [first data edition of the Capital Markets Yearbook](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/business-updates/introducing-the-2024-capital-markets-yearbook) was born. The idea with this Yearbook is for it to be the definitive guide to understand everything about the Indian financial markets.

In the Yearbook, we've put together charts and tables of all the segments of the Indian capital markets across equities, debt, forex, commodities, asset management, and more. The idea is to give you a comprehensive overview of the Indian capital markets. Check out the download link in the comments.

I wanted to share a few interesting charts from the yearbook.

Ownership pattern of NSE universe. I had thought that promoter holding had gone down quite a bit, but it is otherwise.
