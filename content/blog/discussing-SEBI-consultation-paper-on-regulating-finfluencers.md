“SEBI’s job is to remove ignorance from the markets and not stupidity,” from Sandeep; if I had to summarise this conversation in one sentence that [Abid and I had with Sandeep,](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/popular/decoding-the-sebi-consultation-paper-on-regulating-financial-influencers) on SEBI's consultation paper on regulating influencers. I guess our job as brokers is also the same, which is the reason why we launched Verified P&L and spend time trying to educate users on all things trading and investing through [Varsity,](https://zerodha.com/varsity/) etc. But the onus is also on investors to be financially aware, have the right expectations, and be skeptical of get-rich-quick schemes and ridiculous claims.
