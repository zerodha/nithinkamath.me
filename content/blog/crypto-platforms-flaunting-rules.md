On one side, SEBI is working on restricting F&O, but on the other side, this crypto F&O ad is on the front page of ET. 

By the way, all these platforms have taken the stance that the 1% TDS rule doesn't apply to crypto F&O. For regular crypto transactions, 1% of the transaction is deducted as TDS. Something for [@nsitharaman](https://x.com/nsitharaman) and [@FinMinIndia](https://x.com/FinMinIndia) to check out.
