Of everyone I’ve met, Adnan has to be one of the most passionate advocates for fitness and getting Indians to participate in active sports. His company, [Devils Circuit](https://www.devilscircuit.com/), has faced its fair share of obstacles and ups and downs — but the mission remains strong: inspiring Indians to take a greater interest in their health and fitness.

And my gut tells me, the time when we truly start caring more about our health is coming soon. 😬
Until then, as Adnan says, the war cry remains: Booyah!!!

Seema and I recently recorded a podcast with Adnan, talking about how fitness and health continue to play a crucial role in our lives — especially after everything we’ve been through (Seema battled cancer, and I went through a stroke).

As Rocky Balboa said, “It ain’t about how hard you’re hit, it’s about how you can get hit and keep moving forward.” 🙂
