I watched a cricket match after a long time, and damn! Every fourth ad is that of a brokerage firm. Sign of good times for the marketsðŸ˜€

I often get asked, both internally and externally, why we don't advertise.

It is a good place to be when you don't have to look at customers in terms of acquisition costs (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV). 
This way, we don't have to push customers to take a trade, we can stay spam-free, not have to sell life insurance as an investment, and more.
