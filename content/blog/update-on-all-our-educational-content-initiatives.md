Some people, jokingly perhaps, say, "Zerodha is a content company." But this isn't something we are doing now. We've been sharing everything we know about finance, markets, and investing since day 1 of Zerodha in text formâ€”even before "content" was a thing. In fact, Z-Connect is one of the oldest finance blogs in India.

It's just that now we are publishing a lot more video content across [@ZerodhaVarsity](https://x.com/ZerodhaVarsity), [@zerodhamarkets](https://x.com/zerodhamarkets), [@zerodhaonline](https://x.com/zerodhaonline), [@Rainmatterin](https://x.com/Rainmatterin), Zero1 and there's [@nikhilkamathcio's](https://x.com/nikhilkamathcio) WTF and [@kmr_dilip's](https://x.com/kmr_dilip) The Other Side as well. 
[@PrateekLearnapp](https://x.com/PrateekLearnapp), [@HansiMehrotra](https://x.com/HansiMehrotra), and many others have been instrumental in helping us create all this.

Given that we are sharing all this, people think we just started creating content, but that isn't the case. It's just that we went from text to video. The North Star with all that we share has always been the same: share useful things without any expectation.
