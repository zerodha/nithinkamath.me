For most traders living in the social media bubble, it must seem like everyone except you is killing it trading the markets. FYI, it mostly ain't real. Trading is one of the toughest ways to make money & the kind of volatility of the last few months makes it even tougher.

Btw, bear market rallies are usually quite ferocious. While shorts make money faster compared to longs because markets tend to fall faster than they go up. But bounce backs like these after a fall makes it really hard to book profits on time or continue holding shorts.
