Today is the first National Space Day ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

It's a matter of pride that we have many amazing homegrown space startups, like [@AgnikulCosmos](https://x.com/AgnikulCosmos) and [@GalaxEye](https://x.com/GalaxEye), both from the [@Rainmatterin](https://x.com/Rainmatterin) portfolio.

Agnikul recently tested the worldâ€™s first 3D-printed rocket engine and is aiming to launch a satellite by 2025.

Considering the cutting-edge research and technology needed, spacetech startups, more than other startups, need patient capital. So here's hoping we'll have more homegrown spacetech startups that will make us proud. ðŸ’ªðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
