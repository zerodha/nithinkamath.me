description: The more we ask...

---

We Indians need to question what goes into the food we consume. The more we ask, the better choices we will have. The sugar content in most of our food is ridiculous. Adulteration in food items like masalas, milk and protein. And then there are substandard chemicals used in food coloring and preservatives in fruits and vegetables. 

They are all slowly killing us. This applies to both packaged foods and food from many restaurants.
