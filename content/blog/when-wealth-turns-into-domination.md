description:  It makes me wonder...

I didn't realise that lands from Muscat and Oman, the UAE, all the way to Burma were once part of the British Indian Empire. I'd always thought of India's partition as only involving India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

Shattered Lands by [Sam Dalrymple](https://x.com/SamDalrymple123) is a must-read for history buffs. And thanks to good genes, I guess. :) 

The Anarchy by [William Dalrymple](https://x.com/DalrympleWill) is still one of my favourites. It tells the story of how the East India Company came to India to trade, became immensely wealthy, and, in their pursuit of more, became ruthless.

It makes me wonder: today, as trillion-dollar companies rise, what happens if they turn evil, too?
