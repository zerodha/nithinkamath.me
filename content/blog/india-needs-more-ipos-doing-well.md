Congrats to Ola Electric, Unicommerce, and First Cry on the listing. Based on the listing, it looks like investors are happy ðŸ˜‰

If our markets have to grow, we need more homegrown companies to list and also leave something on the table for IPO investors. 

IPOs doing well are good because they incentivize more companies to consider an IPO, and attract more retail and institutional investors.

We also need more IPOs because, as Ananth Narayan, the WTM at SEBI, recently pointed out, we seem to have a problem with the supply of new securities. This is a problem at a time when domestic flows are increasing.
