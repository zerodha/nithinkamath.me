I'm cherry-picking the date, but it's kinda crazy that since 2000 gold seems to have generated higher returns than Nifty.

We couldn't time the launch of the GOLDCASE, [Zerodha Fund House's](https://x.com/ZerodhaAMC) Gold ETF any betterðŸ˜¬ First, gold prices started shooting up and then the stopping of sovereign gold bonds (SGBs).  Now that SGB issuance has stopped, Gold ETFs are probably the best way to get exposure to gold.

Gold has been kind to Indian investors and has provided some diversification benefit. Nobody can explain what makes gold prices move, but it seems to work.
