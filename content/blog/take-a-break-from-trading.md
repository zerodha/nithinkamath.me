description: Itâ€™s best to stand aside...

---

Good time to follow this advice. Over the next 10 days, there are only 4 trading days. Itâ€™s not a bad idea to take a break from trading and recharge. Judging by whatâ€™s happening, youâ€™re going to need it. ðŸ˜¬

"Trading profitably requires that you monitor the market moods and your psychological moods. When either one is not conducive to trading, itâ€™s best to stand aside and wait for the situation to change. Donâ€™t make the mistake of thinking you should trade even in these potentially debilitating conditions. By staying out of the markets, you can survive to trade another day, when youâ€™re in a peak performance mental state and the market conditions are optimal." 

Btw, Innerworth articles on [Varsity](https://x.com/ZerodhaVarsity) are about trading psychology, and they are a goldmine.
