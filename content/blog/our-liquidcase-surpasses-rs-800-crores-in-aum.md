Our Liquid ETF (LIQUIDCASE) just about 3 months old, but it has grown phenomenally. The AUM crossed Rs 800 crores, and the volumes have been consistently picking up. 

This is India's first Liquid ETF with a growth NAV. Unlike other liquid ETFs, you don't have to deal with fractional units, figure out what your actual return is, and face issues when filing your taxes.
