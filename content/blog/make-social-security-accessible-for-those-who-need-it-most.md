Most people from economically weaker sections aren’t aware of government schemes like PMSBY (₹20/year for ₹2 lakh accident cover) or PMJAY / Ayushman Bharat (₹5 lakh health cover).

We recently invited [Haqdarshak](https://x.com/haqdarshak) to run an enrollment camp at our office for housekeeping, admin, and security staff. If you employ people, consider doing this. It removes all the usual barriers to enrollment. The schemes are well-designed; the real problem is awareness and access.

We all will know someone who could benefit. Spread the word where you can.
