The number of things that have to align for a business to get off the ground and do well is ridiculous. Zerodha could start with a bare minimum capital and no tech background in 2010 only because [NSE India](https://twitter.com/NSEIndia) offered NOW, a free trading platform built by Omnesys.

Over the years, Omnesys has changed hands many times, and it's finally back home, where I was invited to open their first officeâ€”the circle of life ðŸ˜¬

Omnesys was first sold to Thomson Reuters, then to Blackstone-Refinitv, then to the London Stock Exchange, and now back to some of the people who originally built it. They are now called OmneNEST.

Omnesys is the backend execution management system (EMS) that powers most Indian brokers, including us.
