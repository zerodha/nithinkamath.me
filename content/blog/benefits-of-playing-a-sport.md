The one thing that has helped me remain sane and deal with the volatility of life is playing a sport regularly. It hasn't just helped me reduce stress and anxiety, but I think it has also improved my cognitive abilities. Also, I'm almost forced to make healthier lifestyle choices when playing a sport regularly. 

Given the benefits of playing a sport, picking up one If you can is a no-brainer, especially for kids.

Helping entrepreneurs who are trying to get more Indians to play sports is what we're excited about at [Rainmatter](https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin) Health.

And this is me trying to support [Anirudh Pole](https://twitter.com/anirudhpole), who runs a basketball academy called ABC Basketball in Pune. I've agreed to play a game representing Rainmatter against 
[Rannvijay Singha](https://twitter.com/rannvijaysingha) and his team ðŸ˜¬ in their upcoming tournament.
