Congrats to [Swiggy](https://x.com/Swiggy) on the listing.

I had tweeted this in 2019 when we had very few aspirational brands worth investing in. But since then, it's crazy how much the Indian markets have changed in terms of the companies, the investor base, etc.

I hope we see more homegrown brands IPO in the coming years.
