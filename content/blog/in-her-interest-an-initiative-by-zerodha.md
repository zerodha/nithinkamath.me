description:  We’re trying to encourage more women...

---
I still remember that around 2014–15, only 2–3% of our customers were women. Today, that number is about 30%. When I saw this spike, I was surprised and wanted to understand what had changed. So we ran a small survey among a couple of hundred customers.

Roughly 50% of the women use their accounts on their own, while the other 50% have their accounts managed by someone else, such as their husbands, brothers, or children.

The fact that half of the accounts are self-managed is a good start, but this needs to change significantly. We’re trying to encourage more women to take charge of their finances through [inherinterest.club](https://t.co/lMYvlgBMy4) We’re also supporting [Ladies who Lead](https://x.com/ladieswholead_)
and other initiatives.

If you have any suggestions on what else we could do, I’d love to hear them.
