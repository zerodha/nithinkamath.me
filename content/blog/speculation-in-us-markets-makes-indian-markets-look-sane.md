If you think the Indian markets are speculative, the US markets will blow your mind. It's pure speculative mania there - you can bet on literally anything. Options on every asset imaginable, crypto markets 24/7, sports betting, weather derivatives, and political outcomes through platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. In a sense, every aspect of American life has been gamified and turned into something you can bet on.

This is probably why the government increased STT? 😬
