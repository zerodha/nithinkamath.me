The amount of love this has gotten is quite crazy. I was just asking K, 'How does it make sense that there are tech companies worth billions and trillions of dollars who use these pieces of open source software without which they could not exist, and yet are unwilling to fund them?'

We’ve been funding open source projects from ~2018 on and off before setting up FLOSS/fund in 2024. We run on open source, so supporting is a no-brainer. 

Our support for ffmpeg received a lot of unexpected goodwill among the open source community internationally, which, as a business, are not even our target customers. As such, I don’t understand why tech businesses don’t do this. Barring everything, they could at least do it out of their marketing budgets for the sake of publicity? It would be a win-win.

And btw, the credit for the support goes to K (Kailash) and our tech team. I had posted [this earlier.](https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1982682344114016566)
