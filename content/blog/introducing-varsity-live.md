If you want to learn anything about trading, investing, and personal finance, I don't think there's a better place than [@ZerodhaVarsity](https://zerodha.com/varsity/). The idea of Varsity began with a random email I sent to [@karthikrangappa](https://x.com/karthikrangappa?s=21&t=UlLwbUij830BIu7fmvFyoA) in 2014, and today, it's one of the most popular free and open resources for all things stock markets, not just in India but maybe globally.

The website has over 15 comprehensive modules and gets millions of hits. There are over 1 lakh comments from readers, 400K+ YouTube subscribers, and 2 million mobile app downloads. All of this is organic from traders and investors discovering and sharing Varsity ðŸ˜€

While we've solved the problem of providing high-quality and free content for everyone, the one problem that remained was an interactive learning experience. Maybe this is partly why people pay for scammy seminars. So, we figured we might as well do something about it.

We're super excited to introduce Varsity Live. 

Instead of just listening to experts, you can learn by doing with them. For example, you can apply indicators when learning about technical analysis or analyze a balance sheet when learning about fundamental analysis.

Here's an intro and a [link to the upcoming sessions](https://t.co/oCCquFwq43).
