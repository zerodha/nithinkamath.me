We just revamped the Kite MarketWatch and made it much cooler.

1. You can now create custom groups for instruments in your MarketWatch. You can group them based on strategies, themes, sectors, etc. For example, you can have a custom group with all the contracts required for an options strategy like an Iron Condor.

2. We've also added pre-built watchlists with all the stocks of broader indices, sector indices, and thematic indices like Bank Nifty. With a couple of clicks, you can quickly see what's happening within an index.

3. You can now create 25 different watchlists with 250 stocks per watchlist.

There's a lot more. Check out [this post](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/introducing-new-marketwatch-on-kite) for more.
