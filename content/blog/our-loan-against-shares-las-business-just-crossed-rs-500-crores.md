Our Loan Against Shares (LAS) business just crossed Rs 500 crores. 

It's a business that we hadn't spoken about much for a long time, for a variety of reasons, including regulatory. But the reason why we offer LAS via [Zerodha Capital](https://x.com/zerodhacapital) is that it's a secured product. 

The other reason is that I think it's a good way to help clients clear their high-interest loans, like personal loans, credit card dues, etc. You'd be shocked at the number of people with investments who haven't heard of LAS and end up taking personal loans.
