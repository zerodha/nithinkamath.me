description:  People simply don't trust...

---
Historically, people haven't bought life and health insurance because of all the scams and spam. The trust deficit in insurance is way too high. People simply don't trust people who sell insurance.

I'm really happy that [Ditto](https://x.com/joinditto) is doing whatever it can to fix this.
