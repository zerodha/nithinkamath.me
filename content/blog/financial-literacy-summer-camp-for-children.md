It's crazy the number of times friends, family, and customers have mentioned that they wish finance was taught when they were in school. Unfortunately, it's too late to fix that - that ship has sailed ðŸ˜¬

We can, however, make sure our kids learn about money. We're doing a Financial Literacy Summer Camp for children via Varsity Live to do just that. Registration link in the comment.
