We, just launched [Portfolio Performance Curve on Console](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/introducing-the-portfolio-performance-curve-on-console). This allows you to visualize your account performance, and you can compare it to a benchmark like Nifty 50. We're probably the only broker to offer this feature in India and possibly worldwide.

The performance curve is calculated in a similar way to the NAV of mutual funds. The daily NAV is calculated using the P&L of all trades across equity intraday and delivery, F&O, commodities, MTF, and mutual funds based on the cash in the account. 

The idea with benchmarking is to show you that if you are underperforming, maybe investing in an index fund would be better for you. ðŸ™ˆ

It was on our list of things to do for a long time, but there were way too many moving pieces, and it got delayed.
