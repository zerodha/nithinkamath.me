description: We are finally launching...

I don't know if it is a good time with the fall in the markets ðŸ˜¬, but we are finally launching MTF (margin trading facility) which allows you to buy stocks for delivery by borrowing money from us.

I haven't been sure about this product for a long time because of obvious reasons. Customers who trade for delivery tend to ignore the impact of the cost of borrowing, and there's always the risk of the trade going against them, which leads to a bigger loss.

But in the last 3 to 4 years, MTF has grown tremendously, with pretty much everyone offering it. Considering the number of customers asking us for the feature, it didn't make business sense for us to not offer it.

But yeah, like with everything else, we will never push this to customers and trigger them to trade.
