A personal problem I had was that there wasn't a short ~15 minute podcast that covered the top 3â€“5 markets and business stories in a given day. There are many in the US, but none in India.

So we started The Daily Brief by [@zerodhamarkets](https://x.com/zerodhamarkets). It's a daily podcast that gives you a quick overview of the big stories in the markets.

It's been quickly climbing the rankings on every platform in the business category. Of course, podcasts are still relatively new in IndiaðŸ˜€

You can listen to The Daily Brief across Spotify and Apple or watch it on YouTube. We also publish the podcast as a daily newsletter on Substack.
