Here's something awesome üòç

Reshma, Lakshmi, Kirat, and Yamini are four young 8th- and 9th-standard girls from rural and socially disadvantaged communities in Karnataka. They published a scientific research paper in a peer-reviewed international journal on an innovative method for synthesizing copper oxide nanoparticles for water purification, with the help of three researchers from Prayoga. What's even more impressive is that these girls are the first in their families to go to school.

This was done as part of their Anveshana project, which is nurturing India's next generation of researchers from grades 9 to 12. Given our abysmally low R&D spending, we need more such initiatives that inspire young kids to dream big.

[Prayoga Institute of Education Research](https://x.com/PrayogaIER) is a non-profit that, apart from all the R&D effort, does education research and helps make education policies based on the data it collects.

Proud to support through Zerodha. The second image is when a few of us visited Prayoga.
