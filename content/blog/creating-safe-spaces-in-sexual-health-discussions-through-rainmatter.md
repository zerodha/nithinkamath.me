The one important type of health we don't talk about is sexual health for obvious reasons. But the numbers are scary:

Male infertility now accounts for 50% of infertility cases in India.

1 in 10 Indian men experience erectile dysfunction.
India has one of the highest rates of untreated STIs globally, especially among youth and migrant populations.
56% of Indian women report some form of sexual dysfunction.

Over the last few years, we've realised that health issues among Indians have increased and will continue to increase because of poor quality food, air, water, and lifestyles in general.

We've been [supporting startups](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/rainmatter/investing-in-better-conversations-around-sexual-health) working on helping Indians be healthier and have supported about 40 health-focused startups with patient capital so far.

The conversation around sexual health has to change, so we're now supporting [Allo Health](https://x.com/allohealth_care) and [Boldcare](https://x.com/getboldcare) as they try to change the way we talk about sexual health.

About the investment, because it is about 3eX, one of the folks on the team just joked, from broking to boners.ðŸ¥¶
