Today's [Finshots](https://finshots.in/archive/india-is-trying-to-ban-single-use-plastic-again/) talks about the 300 million tonnes of plastic the world produces every year and the irreversible damage we together cause the planet. We RainmatterOrg  were blown away when we first met [Zerocircle](https://www.zerocircle.in) who are working on an alternative to plastic using seaweed. 

Zerocircle is building a compostable & ocean-safe alternative to plastics from farmed seaweed, which dissolves harmlessly in the ocean after use. These are the ideas that really need to scale so that they lower costs & achieve mass adoption for the sake of our planet. ðŸ¤ž
