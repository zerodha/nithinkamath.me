Free and open source software (FOSS) has been the pillar on which Zerodha is built. Our tech team has been funding & contributing to FOSS. [We've signed the FOSS pledge](https://fossunited.org/foss-pledge) & hope that companies benefitting from FOSS also sign & start giving back.

Here are some [Indian FOSS projects](https://githubindia.com/open-source/projects), including [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com) and [Listmonk](https://listmonk.app/) (built and open-sourced by Dr.K).
