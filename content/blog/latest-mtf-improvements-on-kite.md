Our MTF (Margin Trading Facility) book grown to ~Rs 3,000 crores within 6 months of launch. Half the time, we were in a bear market-like conditions.

The good news is that our clients are sitting on a combined profit on their MTF position. I don't know if it will eventually be like this, but at least for now, they are profitable.

By the way, the MTF component of a business, which we had resisted for so long, has acted as a revenue hedge for the business against a drop in options business and a drop in transaction charge revenue.

We have been able to keep the brokerage rates and DP charges the same as before the regulatory action, thanks to MTF.

And we just improved the Margin Trading Facility (MTF) feature on Kite:
* Easily convert MTF positions to delivery.
* Increased limits: Trade up to ₹5 crore per stock and ₹25 crore per account.
* Use MTF for over 1,300 stocks with up to 5X leverage.
* Place GTT and AMO orders.
