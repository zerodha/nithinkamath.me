We started [Rainmatter](https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin) in 2016 to support fintech startups working on helping people do better with their money. So far, we have invested ~ Rs 400 crores in 80 startups. In this journey, we realized that having patient Indian investors backing Indian founders is helpful. We're now allocating Rs 1000 crores more to back entrepreneurs building for India.

Good businesses cannot be built overnight, something we learned in our journey. So we are perennial investors and stick with the founders for as long as it takes the founders to build a sustainable business. 
The upside from our investment goes toward supporting other entrepreneurs and [Rainmatter Foundation](https://twitter.com/RainmatterOrg).
