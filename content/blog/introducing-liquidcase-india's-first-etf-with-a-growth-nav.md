LIQUIDCASE, India's first ETF with a growth NAV from [ZerodhaAMC](https://twitter.com/ZerodhaAMC) just listed today with the same symbol. When we were thinking about the product, we wanted to offer something simple where investors didn't have to bother about dividends, taxes etc.

So, the way LIQUIDCASE works is simple: the returns in the ETF will be added to the NAV just like growth mutual funds, and there are no dividends. This makes it easier for you to track your returns, and there are no hassles with fractional units and figuring out your taxes.

The ETF tracks the Nifty 1D Rate Index, and it's return profile will be similar to that of overnight mutual funds. So, better than most savings bank account interest rates.
