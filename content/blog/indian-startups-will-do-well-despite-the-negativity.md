"Investment is the discipline of relative selection‚Äù - Sid Cottle.

Indian startups will most likely continue to attract foreign capital even if all the news might make it seem otherwise. This is mainly because we are the fastest-growing country in the world, and investing is about selecting the best from all the existing options. It is a relative decision, and global investors have to invest.

By the way, anecdotally talking to some international investors, Indian startups seem to be faring better in the last year or so, where the focus has been more on reducing burn & getting on the path to profitability.

Reducing spending isn't impacting the growth and revenue for many of our startups as much as it is for counterparts in other countries. ü§û
