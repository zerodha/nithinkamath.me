Budget summary for us

STT on options goes up from 0.062% to 0.1%. STT on futures goes up from 0.0125% to 0.02% from October 1st. 

We collected about Rs 1500 crores of STT last year, [@zerodhaonline](https://x.com/zerodhaonline). If the volumes don't drop, this will increase to about Rs 2500 crores at the new rates.

The long-term capital gains tax has been increased from 10% to 12.5%, and the short-term capital gains tax has been increased from 15% to 20%. Both will be applicable from today.

If the idea was to cool down the activity in the markets, this might just do the trick ðŸ˜¬
