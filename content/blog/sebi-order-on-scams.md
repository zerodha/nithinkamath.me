SEBI recently passed two orders related to two different scams.

In the first scam, an SME company raised Rs 44 crores through an SME-IPO to buy software, among other things. But the company that it was buying software from was a shell company complete with fake financials and a fake list of clients.

The second order was against a popular finfluencer who collected Rs 17 crores by selling courses, seminars, etc.

This just proves that old saying: if something is too good to be true, it almost always is. Taking shortcuts to make a quick buck is the surest way to lose money in the markets.
