There's ₹104,000 crores worth of money and investments lying unclaimed across banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds. The number is from [a post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-money-right-narendra-modi-bo19f/) by our [PM Narendra Modi](https://x.com/narendramodi).

Despite the nomination process being fully online and despite repeated nudges, 62% of Zerodha users with holdings don't have a nominee. If you haven't added any nominees, [it takes barely a couple of minutes](https://support.zerodha.com/category/your-zerodha-account/nomination-process/articles/add-nominee-online-zerodha).  

While adding nominees is a good first step, you still have to inform the nominees. Otherwise, even money and investments with nominees will remain unclaimed. 

To help avoid this, we send an email to the nominees if there's a prolonged period of inactivity in a Zerodha account.

The good news is that there are now various portals for people to claim what belongs to them.
