More Indians today than ever before are aspiring to be entrepreneurs thanks to Government initiatives & messaging,  the media coverage of the startup ecosystem, founder success stories, & more. 

The one thing we need to work on as a nation is to unlock domestic capital for startups/MSMEs. Reduce the dependence on foreign capital and get Indians to back Indian startups. 

It is maybe time for newer products or vehicles that can be used by accredited investors or those who can take higher risks to be able to invest in equity or debt in startups/MSMEs. The appetite in India to invest in newer products is like never before and we need to make use of this opportunity. 

Apart from reducing external capital dependency, this could also mean that wealth created from startups stays in India. 

I'm excited to be part of the National Startup Advisory Council set up by [DPIIT India](https://twitter.com/DPIITGoI) under [Piyush Goyal](https://twitter.com/PiyushGoyal) and pursue the above.
