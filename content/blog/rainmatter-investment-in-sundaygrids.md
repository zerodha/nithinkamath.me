Today, if you are interested in installing some solar panels but don't have the roof space necessary because you live in an apartment or a rented house, there's no solution. Despite the subsidies, only about 10% of urban households have rooftop solar. That means many people are conscious about being sustainable but can't do anything. [SundayGrids](https://www.sundaygrids.com/) is taking an interesting approach to solve this problem. They setup solar power plants in other locations and allow people to reserve a part of the capacity in the plant. This generates credits, which can be used to reduce the power bill, even though the plant is in a different place. They are now live across India.

Various governments are now coming up with regulations to encourage third-party solar models. I think this is a cool way to make solar accessible to the masses. 

We've invested in [SundayGrids](https://www.sundaygrids.com/) through [Rainmatterin](https://rainmatter.com/). Here's the founder talking about [why they started and how the model works](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/rainmatter/sundaygrids-putting-solar-in-the-cloud).
