We met with several partners/ leaders  from the social sector that we work with at [Rainmatter Foundation](https://x.com/RainmatterOrg) yesterday.

It was my first time interacting with so many at once, and the quality and depth of the conversations struck me, far beyond the usual closed-room discussions with founders that revolve around PMF, CAC, DAU/MAU, etc.

Honestly, I felt stressed. 😬I didn’t know what to say to people who aren’t chasing the standard benchmarks in life that most of us are. Many have given up lucrative careers to work for the greater good of society.

This “doing good” deserves far more encouragement. If we could even celebrate 1% of what we do as compared to startup founders based on valuations, user growth, etc that would be a good start.

Oh, and someone asked me to add, just because they work at a non-profit doesn’t mean they don’t earn a salary. 🙂 They do, but their incentives are very different from what drives most of us.
