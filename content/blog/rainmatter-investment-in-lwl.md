description: Introducing Ladies Who Lead...

---

I was surprised to learn from [Adityaghosh](https://x.com/iamadityaghosh), the former head of IndiGo, that the percentage of women working at IndiGo went from 18% to 43% under his leadership. They also have the highest percentage of women pilots and airport managers worldwide. For pilots, it is 18% for IndiGo, while the global average is just 4%!

This is a problem that even we face in our business, especially in tech, product, and leadership roles. This is a systemic problem that isnâ€™t just ours, though.

So when Aabha and Aditya approached us with the intent to address this exact problem through what theyâ€™re doing with [Ladies who lead](https://x.com/ladieswholead_), we couldnâ€™t say no to partnering and investing in them. ðŸ˜Š
