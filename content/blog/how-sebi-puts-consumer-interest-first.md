One challenge in today's media-saturated environment for brokers like us and also regulators is the sheer noise because even small things can be blown out of proportion. 

Having said that, I am part of various committees, and what has always amazed me is the consultative approach that SEBI has taken over the years. No regulation is passed without hearing from the industry and other experts. This shows in the fact that today, our capital markets are among the safest in the world, if not the safest.

Also, for regulators, consumer interest comes first. The tricky thing about being on these committees is that you have to do what is in the best interest of the customer, even if it may not be right for the industry at times. ðŸ˜¬
