You need to know how to manage your money to do well in life. The things you need to know to manage your money well apply to other aspects of life as well. One of the best ways to learn about money is to start early, because the things we learn when we're young tend to stick with us for the rest of our lives. One thing that has been on our to-do list for a long time is to make it as easy for parents to invest for their kids as they teach them about money. We have now made opening Zerodha accounts for kids simple and fully online. You can buy stocks, mutual funds, and bonds and then gift them to your kid, or they can discover stocks on their own and then ask you to buy them on their behalf.
