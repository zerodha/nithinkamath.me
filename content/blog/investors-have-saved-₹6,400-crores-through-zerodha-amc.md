description: The most successful Indian retail ETF launches ever...

---

It's been 18 months since the first fund launch of [Zerodha Fund House](https://x.com/ZerodhaAMC) with [smallcase](https://x.com/smallcaseHQ). The idea was to offer simple and cost-efficient index funds and ETFs and stay direct only. Despite not being loud about the AMC, 7 lakh investors have saved ‚Çπ6,400 crores in our funds.

The hero fund is LIQUIDCASE ETF at ‚Çπ4,700 crores, and this is all in 15 months. LIQUIDCASE has to be one of the most successful Indian retail ETF launches ever. [Vishal Jain](https://x.com/vishaljain2510) and team have done a fabulous job building out the fund offerings.
