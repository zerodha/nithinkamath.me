Just about 10 days left to file your taxes. While figuring out taxation for trading and investments is usually a nightmare, [we've made it super easy.](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/console-3/tax-reports-on-console-to-simplify-filing-your-taxes) I think our tax statements are easily the best in the industry by a mile.

On Console, you’ll find all the statements you need to file taxes for your trades and investments:

Tax P&L statement with trade-wise charges, turnover across all segments, equity and non-equity segregation, capital gains split for pre- and post-July 23, 2024, and more.

Ability to download one year of contract notes at a time. Full tradebooks.

Various filters to make it easy to figure out STCG (short-term capital gains) and LTCG (long-term capital gains). 

And more...
 
If you need help filing your taxes, we've also partnered with [Quicko](https://twitter.com/Quicko_official) to make the process even smoother.
