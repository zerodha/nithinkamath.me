The number of fraud cases involving scammers impersonating brokers and asking for money to be transferred to random accounts has skyrocketed.

To protect investors, SEBI has introduced a new UPI security feature. All legitimate fund transfers will now only go to verified UPI handles like: brokername@validbank (as shown in the image). We [@zerodhaonline](https://twitter.com/zerodhaonline) will implement this soon, and this should help reduce fraud incidents significantly.
