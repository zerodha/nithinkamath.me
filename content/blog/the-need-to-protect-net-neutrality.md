description: We enjoy some of the strongest net neutrality rules in the world...

Recently, there have been talks of revisiting the idea of net neutrality in India. We enjoy some of the strongest net neutrality rules in the world, ensuring a fair and level playing field for everyone to access and innovate on the internet, no matter how big and small. 

The exponential growth of our technology and startup ecosystem would not have been possible without this. Without net-neutrality, there perhaps would not have been a Zerodha. The destiny of our increasingly digital nation is tied to the internet remaining open, accessible, and neutral for everyone.
