A feature that many people are unaware of.

You can buy a stock for intraday on NSE and sell it on BSE (or vice versa) to [capture arbitrage opportunities](https://support.zerodha.com/category/trading-and-markets/general-kite/others-kite/articles/exchange-toggle) if you spot any. Just select the exit exchange from your positions page. Margins get released immediately.

And it can be done regardless of whether you are trading for intraday or holding a stock.
