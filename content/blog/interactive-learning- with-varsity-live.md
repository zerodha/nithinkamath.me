We started [@ZerodhaVarsity](https://x.com/ZerodhaVarsity) almost a decade ago to simplify how the stock market worked in English and Hindi for free. For people who preferred video, we turned all the modules into video. Today, Varsity is easily one of the most read and watched resources for all things financial markets. 

But until now it was self-directed—you had to read, watch, and then learn about things. We had always wanted to introduce an interactive mode of learning about markets, and we finally got around to launching Varsity Live in collaboration with  [@LearnappHQ](https://x.com/LearnappHQ). 

These two-day programmes come with practice tech. You don't just listen to the class—you practice WITH the mentor. So you'd place a mock order, draw trendlines, and calculate your emergency funds using real data. So you learn by doing, not listening. We've reached 45k users from 100 countries—all organic. 

If you've always wanted to learn how the stock market works but never got around to it, [sign up for the next session here](https://varsitylive.zerodha.com/home).
