Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has been an integral part of Zerodha's success. We rely on it heavily to power everything from our products to Z-connect, Tradingqna, and even my laptop (which runs Zorin Linux). Without FOSS, Zerodha wouldn't exist and neither would the larger startup ecosystem.

We have always supported the open source ecosystem in numerous ways and are now formalizing all those efforts by setting up a fund to support FOSS projects globally, starting with $1 million a year. Hopefully, this also inspires other organisations to give back.
