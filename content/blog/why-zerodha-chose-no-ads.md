description: Even if we had advertised..

---
Over 1.6 crore Indians trade and invest with us. Almost 30% of these investors came to us through referrals by other Zerodha customers. Today, all Zerodha investors trust us with 6 lakh crores of their assets.

We may be the only B2C company to have reached this scale without ever advertising. In hindsight, not advertising has helped us stay true to our philosophy of not pushing people to trade, no spam, etc.

India is a very tough market to earn in, and even if we had advertised, we would have given up a lot of our profits to Google, Facebook/Meta, etc.
