Here's the potential impact of only one weekly expiry of index derivatives per exchange and contract sizes going up by around 2.5 times.

As things stand, assuming that those trading weekly don't move on to trading monthly, the impact will be ~60% of overall F&O trades and ~30% of our overall orders.

I guess things will become much clearer from November 20th. We will then decide on our change in pricing structure, based on the impact on the business. ðŸ˜€
