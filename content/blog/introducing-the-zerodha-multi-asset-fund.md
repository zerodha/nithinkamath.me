After 20+ years of being in the markets, one thing has become crystal clear to me: most investors should just invest in low-cost equity, debt, and gold index funds and do something useful with their lives. ðŸ˜¬ Trying to pick the "best fund" or "best asset class" is largely a waste of time and energy.

What most investors don't realize is that they'd get far better returns by focusing on maximizing their earning potential rather than obsessing over picking the "best stocks and funds." The odds are stacked against them anyway.

That's exactly why we launched the [Zerodha AMC Multi Asset Fund](https://www.zerodhafundhouse.com/multi-asset-passive-fof/?source=home-announcement). This single fund gives investors exposure to large-cap and mid-cap equities, government bonds, and gold all in one place. Investors don't have to worry about rebalancing, tax complications, or managing multiple investments. 

There was a famous study from Fidelity that found that their best-performing accounts belonged to people who were either dead or had forgotten they had accounts. The study was made up, but the point still stands.
