description: We would not have started...

I was asked recently on [Tradinqna](https://tradingqna.com/t/zerodha-in-2025/180648/4) 

Hi Nithin sir, I have one specific question for you:

 What would have you done differently if you had to start Zerodha in 2025 all over again with decades of experience considering the competitions.

Me: We would not have started Zerodha ðŸ˜€ The market is so crowded, and being another one doing the same thing wouldnâ€™t work. Also our product has evolved over the last 10 years, I donâ€™t think it would make sense to attempt to beat the best today on day 1 of the business.

I would have probably built a brokerage with some other moat. Charge higher and offer better research, maybe. Of course, the customers would have been much fewer, but you could still earn significantly.
