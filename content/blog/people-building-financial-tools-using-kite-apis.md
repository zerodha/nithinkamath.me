description:  If you have FOMO...

My feed is filled with people vibe coding all sorts of financial tools using [Kite APIs](https://zerodha.com/products/api/) like portfolio dashboards, backtesting setups, market insight tools, and even automated trading setups. A lot of these things are useless but there are some genuinely well thought out tools, built to solve very specific problems that traders and investors have.

And most of these people have never written a line of code in their life. Just plain English and AI coding tools like Claude Code, Codex, etc.

If you have FOMO to try these tools but don't know where to start, try our [MCP plugin](https://t.co/mn2nKfEpby) first. Connect it to your Zerodha account and just start asking it things. You get a real sense of what's possible before you start using AI coding tools.
