The Social Stock Exchange (SSE) is a platform for social organizations to raise funds from the public. So far, 6 non-profit organizations have raised money, and we are happy to have supported them.

There's no online mechanism to donate to these organizations like we have for regular IPOs but I'm hoping this will soon be possible. We will then make it possible for all [@zerodhaonline](https://twitter.com/zerodhaonline) customers to support social sector organizations working on important issues.

The idea is to show a new section called "giving" on the console portfolio view, along with stock holdings. This will hopefully nudge people to give a little.

SSE is a wonderful initiative because it can potentially help bridge the trust deficit that affects many social organizations. Check out [this launch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vfpbL622_0) we had recorded.
