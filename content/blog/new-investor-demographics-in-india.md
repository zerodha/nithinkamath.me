For the longest time, most of the investors in the Indian markets were more or less from the major metro cities. But this has changed dramatically after COVID. The bulk of new investors are from North India, and we've kinda missed out on getting them to invest with us.

This was something interesting that came up when I was catching up with[Ashish Chauhan](https://x.com/ashishchauhan) as he shared the [NSE India](https://x.com/NSEIndia) coffee table book.
