If you feel the pulse of the US through Twitter, it definitely feels like Trump. But Twitter is a bubble and doesn't necessarily represent the election results, or reality for that matter.

What makes it even more skewed is that the majority of the tweets are generated by less than ~1% of Twitterâ€™s user base. 

So yeah, I don't know. But it's definitely not wise to form views based on your Twitter feed.
