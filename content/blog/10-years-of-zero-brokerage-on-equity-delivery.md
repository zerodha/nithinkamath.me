It's been around 10 years since we waived off brokerage for equity delivery. Even though there is extreme pressure to change the stance, given option trading volumes are down significantly, we've stuck with this so far.

Over the 10 years of being free, our clients have saved between Rs 2000 and 20,000 crores as equity delivery brokerage.

And yeah, Zerodha = Zero + Barriers (Sanskrit), not Zero + brokerage. ðŸ˜¬
