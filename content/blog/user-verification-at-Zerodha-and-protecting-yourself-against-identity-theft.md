With the rise of online loan platforms, online identity frauds have skyrocketed. These platforms tend to have poor checks when onboarding, given the competitive landscape and pressure to show fast user growth. 

Today, it is possible to verify all the proofs submitted by a customer very easily by matching them against the source.
PAN through Income tax database.
Proof of Identity & Address through Digilocker.
Bank details using penny drop facility. 

Live in-person verification (IPV) to check if the person opening the account & details being used are of the same person—the most important step to stop identity thefts.
