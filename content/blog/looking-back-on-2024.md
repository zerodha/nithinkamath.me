Looking back, 2024 was probably the best year for the brokerage industry, and it's starting to look like the best is behind us, at least for the foreseeable future. ðŸ˜¬ 

In terms of options turnover, we are back to 2022â€“23 levels. This is even before the impact of the increased lot sizes, which take effect in January 2025. 

We just published a post reviewing 2024 at both Zerodha and across the broking industry.   The link to the full post is [here](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/business-updates/reviewing-2024-a-year-of-transitions).
