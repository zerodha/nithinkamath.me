I have a vested interest in saying this ðŸ˜¬ being part of [@ZerodhaAMC](https://twitter.com/ZerodhaAMC), but it's a no-brainer to use low-cost index funds for your core portfolio. You can complement that with other funds, but the core should be passive funds.

The data shows it's getting increasingly harder for active funds to outperform their benchmarks.
