Between 50,000 and 80,000 crores of assets are unclaimed across demat accounts, mutual funds, insurance, etc. This is because most investors don't add nominees to their investors. In fact, 72% of Individual investors don't have a nominee for their demat accounts and mutual fund folios. Even if investors do add nominees, they don't tell their nominees.

Life is unpredictable, and anything can happen. It's not a pleasant thought, but making sure life is as comfortable as possible for your loved ones in your absence is a key part of life.
