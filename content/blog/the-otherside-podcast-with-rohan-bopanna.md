Playing a sport you enjoy is one of the most accessible ways to be physically and mentally fit. Doing well in sports is also a great way to build on national identity and pride.
If more Indians have to play a sport & be healthier, maybe those who have played sports at the highest levels are best placed to popularize sports. 

It is fantastic to see sportsmen like [Rohan Bopanna](https://twitter.com/rohanbopanna) sponsoring other athletes, running academies and investing in sports businesses. Thanks, Rohan, for doing The Otherside podcast with [Dilip](https://twitter.com/kmr_dilip) and spending time with the [Rainmatter Health](https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin) team.
