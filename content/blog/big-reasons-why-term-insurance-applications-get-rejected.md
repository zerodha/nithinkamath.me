Getting adequate life insurance if you have dependents is the first thing you should do before you save, invest, etc. Having said that, not all life insurance policy applications are approved. 

The [Ditto](https://x.com/joinditto) team was telling me that 30% of term life insurance applications get rejected. Apparently, one of their biggest teams internally helps customers navigate policy rejections. 

Big reasons why applications get rejected. 

If you need assistance with insurance, you can schedule a call with an insurance advisor at [Ditto](https://joinditto.in/?utm_source=Ditto&utm_campaign=CM14594&utm_medium=Twitter)
