These fake app and website scams keep getting worse and worse. Not a day goes by where I don't read about such scams or hear from people who've been affected. The scale of these scams is just insane.

There are now countless phishing scams that take advantage of the familiarity of all major brands, celebrities, etc. The tricks vary—fake apps, fake websites, fake social media profiles, scam calls—but all with the same goal: to steal your money. We've discovered multiple such scams in the name of Zerodha.

These scams work because they take advantage of our emotions like hope, fear, and greed. Two simple rules that can protect you:
1. Never act in a hurry and always verify. 
2. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. 

Be extremely suspicious about everything. If you're seeing this post, you're probably already aware of these scams, so please [share this](https://youtu.be/gPXXO4DrNPs?si=SWrs2yqv5hWvGBwi) with your friends and family who might be more vulnerable.
