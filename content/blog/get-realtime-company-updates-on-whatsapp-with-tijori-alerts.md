Access to information is what drives prices in markets. While there's no shortage of information today, the real challenge is figuring out what actually matters and getting it in time. 

Exchange filings, earnings, management commentary, and conference calls. When something material comes out, prices react almost instantly. The faster you get the information, the better your odds of reacting sensibly. 

Institutions and high-frequency trading desks scan exchange filings the moment they're published and act within milliseconds. Retail investors usually find out much later—by then, the price has often already moved. 

[Tijori](https://www.tijorialerts.com/) just released the WhatsApp alerts feature. It tracks exchange filings, earnings releases, conference calls, management guidance, verified company tweets, and anything that could materially impact a stock. The moment something is published, it's summarised using AI and sent to you on WhatsApp within seconds. 

For traders, this means getting access to critical filings during market hours, well before traditional news or media picks them up. 

For investors, it’s a simpler way to stay informed without having to search for news for each stock or rely on social media commentary. 

And even if you’re just getting started with investing, work in a company, or run a business, it’s a useful way to track competitors. Follow companies in a sector and get real-time updates of their key announcements and actions. 

You can enable alerts by visiting the Tijori Alerts website or directly from the Kite Fundamentals widget. More [here.](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/general/tijori-alerts-stock-exchange-filings-on-whatsapp)
