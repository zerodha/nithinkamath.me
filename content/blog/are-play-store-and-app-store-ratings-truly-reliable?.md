I wonder how many [Google](https://twitter.com/GoogleIndia) Play Store and [Apple](https://twitter.com/Apple) App Store reviews are genuine. I was going through Zerodha's reviews and compared them with those of other financial services apps in India. Most of the 5-star reviews seem fakeâ€”many even read like AI-generated content.

I'm guessing many apps are either willingly or forcibly buying ratings to rank higher in their category. So there's probably an entire parallel economy selling app ratings.
