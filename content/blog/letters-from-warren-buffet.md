Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are arguably the greatest investors ever. Their track record over 50â€“60 years is just insane.

Warren Buffett has been writing letters to shareholders since 1965. These letters contain a wealth of wisdom, not just for stockpickers but for all investors as well.

If you don't have the time to read all the letters, we're starting a new series on [Varsity](https://twitter.com/ZerodhaVarsity) to summarize all the letters. Check out the [first episode](https://youtu.be/pZ_Ka4s5fRk?si=7xgLIdnwm5bRwJjv), in which the team discusses the first 5 letters. This covers the origins of the legendary partnership between Buffett and Munger, their thoughts on inflation, Buffett's investment approach, and much more.
