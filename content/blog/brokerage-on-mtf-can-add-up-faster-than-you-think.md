MTF is booming, but here’s the catch: many traders track the interest rate and ignore brokerage. Brokerage on MTF can add up faster than you think 😬

MTF is a leveraged product, so you are already taking a significant risk. If you don’t pay attention to costs while using leverage, the math gets worse because your breakeven point moves higher for the trade.

Rule of thumb: on shorter holding periods and smaller price moves, brokerage can be the difference between breakeven and a loss.
