Among all investment scams, the one that has claimed the most victims is the WhatsApp investment scam.

Here's how the scam works:

Step 1: You're added to a group with names like "Zerodha Elite Traders" or "Premium Investors Club." The logo, colors, and even SEBI license numbers look legit. The admins pose as me, Nikhil, Venu, or some of our employees.

Step 2: Within hours, the chat is flooded with screenshots of 100â€“200% intraday returns and testimonials. All of them are fake.

Step 3: They peddle "premium signals" and link to a fake app that looks exactly like Kite. Once you deposit money, the dashboard shows imaginary profits.

Step 4: When you try to withdraw the profits, you're told to pay processing fees, taxes, and verification charges. The scammers then take the money and vanish.

Note: Zerodha does not offer stock tips, investment advice, or run WhatsApp/Telegram trading-signal groups. All official communication comes only through our verified channels.
