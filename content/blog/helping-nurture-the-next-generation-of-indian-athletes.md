I think one of the easiest ways to be healthy is to pick up a sport you like. The one thing that helps people pick up a sport is seeing someone inspiring. Imagine how many Indians play cricket because of Sachin, etc. 

Sadly, while there are countless talented athletes in India, not all of them have the resources and ongoing support to make India proud. Is there something that we can do to support more young athletes is something we had been asking ourselves at 
[@Rainmatterin](https://x.com/Rainmatterin) health. 

Along the way, we met [@nandankamath](https://x.com/nandankamath) and [@unmish1](https://x.com/unmish1) from the [@GoSportsVoices](https://x.com/GoSportsVoices) Foundation, and we are super excited about supporting them unconditionally. They are trying to nurture the next generation of young Indian athletes. They are not only trying to help them financially but also all the other important things like training, fitness, nutrition, mental health, etc. 

Here's hoping we'll see more Indian gold medalists in the years to come.
