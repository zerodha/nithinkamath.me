Right from day 1 of Zerodha, we've spent a significant amount of time and effort to educate people about finance through [Zerodha Varsity](https://zerodha.com/varsity/), [Z-Connect](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/), [Tradingqna](tradingqna.com/), etc. Since video was becoming the dominant way people consumed information, we also launched [Varsity videos](https://www.youtube.com/@varsitybyzerodha). Along the way, we've been debating whether all this content we were publishing appealed to younger audiences. We're launching a new YouTube channel called Zing! by Zerodha in partnership with [Prateek](https://twitter.com/PrateekLearnapp)  and Learnapp where we make finance a little more fun. Here's the first video is on {De-influencing](https://youtu.be/Kgigwie_XZc).
