At [Rainmatter](https://rainmatter.com/) Health, we're experimenting with something beyond just writing checks. 

We're creating participatory sports events through an initiative called [Peakst8 Club](https://www.peakst8.club/). We've been going around the country with Founders Peak—getting health founders (and others) to participate, not just network over coffee. 

Last weekend was our first grand event: "No Parking." Booked the entire basement at Brigade, Orion Mall (thanks, Nirupa Shankar!), Bengaluru. Around 1,000 runners representing 38 corporates, 45 communities, and 43 run clubs were participating in various activities, including running, rowing, cycling, and more. The energy was incredible.

The thesis is simple: people need more reasons to think about fitness. The odds of people wanting to get fit may be higher if they see the fun and participatory side. 

The next big one is the Peakst8 festival in January.
