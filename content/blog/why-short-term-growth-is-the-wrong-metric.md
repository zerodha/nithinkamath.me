On the question of [what would we do if weekly options were removed](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/business-updates/15-years-of-zerodha-the-risk-crystallises), I suppose we'll see another hit to our revenues in the short-term. 

Having said that, when you're building a business for the long term, focusing on quarterly or even annual growth is a poor metric. The more you focus on them, the higher the odds that you'll do things that are bad for your customers.
