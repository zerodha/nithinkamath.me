3x increase in rural incomes (~Rs 10,000 to ~Rs 30,000). 1200 farmers and artisans are earning much more. 11 lakh bamboo trees planted.
384 metric tons of plastic were kept out of landfills. 312232 metric tons of CO2 offset.

The last few years of partnering [Amwoodo](https://twitter.com/amwoodo) and [Agni Mitra](https://twitter.com/akaagnee) have been special. And yeah, the business is for profit and quite profitable.

I really hope these numbers keep increasing as the business grows and has to deal with other pressures and competing priorities. We need more such businesses in India.
