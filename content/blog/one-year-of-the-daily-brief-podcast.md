description:  What began as a small idea ...

---
We started The Daily Brief podcast and newsletter as a random experiment, and for many people, it's become their daily newspaper. On average, over 60,000 to 1 lakh people watch or read The Daily Brief every day.

Almost all of this is because people genuinely enjoy the content and share it with their friends. Honestly, I didnâ€™t expect this when I first asked the team to start a daily podcast. What began as a small idea has now grown into something bigger. We now publish several other shows and newsletters like The Chatter, Aftermarket Report, and more. Whatâ€™s even cooler is that the entire markets project is run by a bunch of young kids.

At a time when people are consuming less and less mainstream news, itâ€™s great to see that weâ€™ve become a trusted source of financial insights. Not just through [Markets by Zerodha](https://x.com/zerodhamarkets), but also through [Varsity](https://x.com/zerodhavarsity), [Zero1](https://x.com/Zero1ByZerodha), and others.

What still surprises me is that people are actually reading. Real words. Long-form writing. ðŸ˜¬
