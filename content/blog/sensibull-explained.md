I first met [Abid Hassan](https://x.com/abidsensibull) 12 years ago when he and his friends were building the first version of [Sensibull](https://x.com/BeSensibull). The original idea was to help traders and investors make better decisions, like helping them avoid going against the trend, being diversified, etc. In many ways, they were well ahead of their time. We couldn't figure out how to make the platform work while complying with regulations.

Abid went back to trading options for a trading desk, but I continued peddling him the idea that he should start something related to the markets.

In 2018, he finally decided to start Sensibull. This time, the idea was to help option traders do better. The problem was extremely close to our hearts, and we backed it through [Rainmatter](https://x.com/Rainmatterin). The idea was to nudge customers to think of strategies versus trading naked and avoid other obvious mistakes.

Today, after being around for 7+ years, I don't think we are successful yet in our mission to help traders ðŸ˜¬. But that said, Abid and the team have come a long way in helping traders do better.

Considering a lot of traders might not know about Sensibull, we thought of making a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO_jERK8JZQ) explaining Sensibull in 2 minutes. ðŸ˜ƒ
