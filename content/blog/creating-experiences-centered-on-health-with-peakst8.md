As I've grown older, I've become increasingly health-conscious. If I could go back in time and change one thing, I would've started focusing on diet, nutrition and sleep much earlier.

With each passing year, I've been thinking more about health and fitness, and I've been trying to encourage those around me, both personally and at work, to prioritise their health.

I've also realised that simple and repeatable behaviours make the biggest difference. It's not about running marathons, living in the gym, or doing Hyrox, or whatever. It's about making small daily choices, such as walking outside instead of doom scrolling, attending a Group fitness class instead of Netflix, opting for grilled over deep-fried, questioning the source of everything you eat, and more. These small decisions, compounded over time, can have a significant impact.

Most of us on the core team in the office are health-conscious, which has led to numerous conversations about how we can help others become healthier. That's when we started supporting founders working on making Indians healthier through [Rainmatter](https://x.com/rainmatterin). Given the current state of air and water quality in our cities, I've been increasingly thinking about what more we can do. 

The newest initiative we recently started, [peakst8](https://x.com/peakst8_club), aims to create offline experiences centred on health. The hope is that these events will encourage people to begin their health and fitness journeys. We've been experimenting with different formats, and now we're hosting our first mega event on Jan 10th in Bengaluru, a full-day health festival with Rainmatter Health portfolio startups and friends from the ecosystem.

But even otherwise, January is supposedly a good time for resolutions. But honestly? Today is as good as it gets.
