Suffice to say, without Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), there would be no Zerodha . Our tech stack is built on open source software. Remember, it is trusted by almost 2 crore Indians with ~₹6 lakh crores of assets, and we contribute about 15% of daily retail exchange volumes in India.

Over the years, we've not only been using FOSS, but have been actively contributing code, money, and time to existing projects. We have also been supporting the FOSS community and ecosystem in India via FOSS United Foundation and others. Recently, we launched a $1 million/year fund to support critical FOSS projects worldwide.

Apart from this, we have open sourced many technologies we have built in-house. Many of these have large global userbases including enterprises, universities, governments, among others.

It wouldn't be an overstatement to say that 4th Cross JP Nagar is a hotbed of FOSS activity in India!
