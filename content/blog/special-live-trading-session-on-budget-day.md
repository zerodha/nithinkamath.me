So, the budget day is tomorrow, and yes, [there is trading on a Saturday](https://zerodha.com/marketintel/bulletin/400094/live-trading-session-on-saturday-february-1-2025). Markets are bound to be volatile, so trade with caution.

If you are an active trader, I guess you should reduce trading size during event days. That is if you cannot stop yourself from trading.

By the way, Zerodha is probably the only broker which will allow you to do BTST (Buy today and sell tomorrow) trades on days of settlement holiday, like tomorrow. So, there are no restrictions; you could buy something today and sell it tomorrow.
