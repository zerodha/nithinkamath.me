The prelude to starting [@RainmatterOrg](https://x.com/RainmatterOrg) in 2021, was that we decided to first get our hands dirty and took on a restoration project in 2020. As luck would have it, [@zenx](https://x.com/zenx) was running a campsite on the land, and that's where we met. We hit it off almost immediately, and the Foundation was born.

Three years since we have a solid theme: chasing various intersections of things that impact the climate and the people and lives that it has an effect on. Be it in the space of Governance (rural & urban), Conservation & Restoration, Energy & Materials. 

One of our strongest beliefs is 'Sense of the house', the need for a sense of ownership for the places we live in that will foster stewardship for that place. If enough people looked at it like this, the world is a place, and it will be better off for it. 

Here is [video on our reflections for the last three years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_PQHjJfvEw).

https://ebtl.earth is the restoration project that got this ball rolling.
