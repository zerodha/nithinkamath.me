In November 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that accessibility is a fundamental right, directing businesses to ensure their digital platforms are accessible to people with disabilities. The Court essentially said that in a digital-first world, denying digital access means denying basic rights. It’s not just about compliance, it’s about constitutional equality.

Accessibility has been core to how we build at Zerodha. The mandate didn’t change our approach, it just gave us a deadline. And since we don’t have to rebuild for accessibility from scratch, we are confident to be able to make the deadline. 🙂
