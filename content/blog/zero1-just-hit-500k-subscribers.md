description: We've put in significant efforts...

---

A couple of years back, a new team member pointed out that we didn't have a good strategy for video content, and he was right. In hindsight, it was obvious ðŸ˜€ We were publishing educational content in text form on Varsity, Z-Connect, etc., but we weren't focusing on videos. We had become like an incumbent, not adapting to the times.

Since then, we've put in significant efforts to publish high-quality video content on all things finance, and slowly but steadily, we've become the go-to destination for people to understand finance and markets.

Our video strategy is the same as it always was: share everything we know and publish content that people will genuinely find useful, regardless of whether it helps Zerodha or not, and whether it gets views or not.

But since the world judges a video by views, and we have never done any performance marketing, our numbers over the last approximately 2 years. And this is just on YouTube, doesnâ€™t include Insta, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. 

[Zero1ByZerodha](https://x.com/Zero1ByZerodha) - ~ 6 crore views
[Zerodha Varsity](https://x.com/ZerodhaVarsity) - ~2.4 crore views
[Markets by Zerodha](https://x.com/zerodhamarkets) - ~1 crore views
[Zerodha](https://x.com/zerodhaonline) - ~1 crore views

All of this excludes Nikhil's [WTF](https://www.youtube.com/@nikhil.kamath), which he has been hitting out of the park, along with all the amazing creators in the Zero1 network.

Why mention it today?

Because Zero1 just hit 500k subscribers in less than 2 years, and maybe we should acknowledge that our video strategy, which was lacking, is in place. ðŸ˜¬

So yeah, thanks to [Prateek Singh](https://x.com/PrateekLearnapp), [Swati Harish](https://x.com/Swati), [Karthik Rangappa](https://x.com/karthikrangappa), [Bhuvan](https://x.com/bebhuvan),[Sagar Gudekote](https://x.com/SagarHerodha), and everyone responsible...
