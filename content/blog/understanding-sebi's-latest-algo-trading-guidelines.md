The SEBI circular on API usage and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces where people share algos for a fee can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.
