[Zerodha Fund House](https://www.zerodhafundhouse.com/) is almost 2 years old, and we have reached ~₹8,000 crores despite not talking much about it. What's cool is that practically all of this AUM comes from individual investors.

The AMC has grown steadily even as competition has intensified, with newer AMCs entering the market and existing AMCs launching more passive funds. We could have grown our AUM faster by offering regular plans and paying commissions, but we've chosen to remain direct-only and focus on easy-to-understand index funds and ETFs like our recently launched multi-asset fund (link in the replies).
