The excitement and enthusiasm among people with disabilities running the Tata Mumbai Marathon today were beyond words. Makes you think about what right you have to complain about anything in life.

On a personal note, [Seema](https://t.co/09hsHMDi6R) ran 10km in ~57 minutes, about 2.5 years after surviving cancer. 😃
