The one question I get asked the most by new customers is: Does Zerodha charge for equity and mutual fund investments?

No, investing in stocks, ETFs, and direct mutual funds at Zerodha is free. We also don't charge any DP charges for mutual funds and bear the cost ourselves.

Also, we only charge a DP charge once per day per stock, regardless of the number of sell orders. So even if you sell a stock ten times in a day, the DP charge only applies once.

Someone just shared this data with me. I'm not sure about its efficacy, but our team has cross-checked it.
