While I understand Pullela Gopichand's concern that "Unless you are rich, don't make your child a sportsperson," I have a different view.

Imagine studying something you don't like or being stuck in a field when you know that your skills are useful elsewhere. Odds are, you may end up being less than average compared to people who are more suited to the field you hate. In this case, how can you expect job security? This is all more problematic in the AI-first world we are entering.

This applies to sports as well. If someone is passionate about sports, takes a shot at being a professional and fails, there are more alternatives today than ever. You can become a coach or a personal trainer. There's more demand for such folks today than at any point.

We are seeing a trend with some of [Rainmatter's](https://x.com/Rainmatterin) partners, like [FITTR](https://x.com/FITTRwithsquats), [Game Theory](https://x.com/gametheoryindia) etc. People are willing to pay for personal training and coaching. We need a few of these to scale well, such as what [Urban Clap](https://x.com/urbanclap) has been able to do for professionals for home services.
