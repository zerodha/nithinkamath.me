"Every time you ask your parents to spend money on things that are not necessary, they have less for what is necessary." 
A beautiful lesson by @karthikrangappa on the value of money from the 2nd episode of @ZerodhaVarsity Junior. This lesson isn't just for kids but for adults as well.
For everyone with kids, [this is a fantastic family watch this weekend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D916Xq4Fbxg).
