Intraday equity is the abandoned baby of Indian markets.

Since the time leverage restrictions were introduced, intraday equity volumes have stagnated, despite the mother of all bull runs. Apart from leverage, the fact that securities Transaction Tax (STT) is higher for intraday equity and futures compared to options has also hurt the volumes. The hope is STT on intraday equity and futures will reduce some day. ðŸ˜¬

Intraday equity trading turnover is important because it significantly reduces the impact cost for those making equity delivery trades.

This is a chart of our order count.
