Many of us inside Zerodha are conscious of our health, and we keep having discussions about food, fitness, nutrition, health gadgets, etc. Inevitably, these discussions would lead to questions like "Is the atta we consume safe?" or "Does milk have harmful antibiotics?" etc. To get answers, we would try to find domain experts and entrepreneurs, and some of the answers we often got weren't pretty, as I alluded to in a previous tweet. So we figured, we were anyway trying to support Indian fintech startups building for India, why not do the same for health? And so 
[Rainmatter Health](https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin) was born.

The goal was to help Indian startups trying to make Indians healthier. It's been a couple of years, and in this journey, we invested over Rs 150 crore in [Akshayakalpa Organic](https://twitter.com/akshayakalpa), Two Brothers Organic, and The Whole Flour and more. 

All these startups are trying to fix the food items that Indians consume the most: staples, milk, wheat flour, eggs, and more. We've not only invested in them but also consume products from the same brands. A happy coincidence is that some of these startups are also working with small farmers and improving their livelihood. So yeah, all this started with asking questions.
