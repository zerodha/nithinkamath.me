description: What really stood out was...

---

Spent the last week in Monaco at the EY World Entrepreneur of the Year event — the first time I’ve ever been part of something like this. And yes, I was “judged” for the first time since school — group discussions and all. 😬

I didn’t win. As Zerodha, we’re building only for India, with a single source of revenue. I guess the judges were looking for something more global, more diversified. Also, I’m probably too anti-social for something like this — public speaking, networking — especially harder after the stroke last year. 😬

But what really stood out was meeting entrepreneurs from 40+ countries. Different cultures, same challenges: How to grow the target market, how to get more active users, how to hire and retain talent, and do all this while still finding time for family 😀

Big congrats to Stina from Yubico for winning this year, and to last year’s winner, [Vellayan Subbiah](https://x.com/Vellayan_S)— what a masterclass in public speaking.

My biggest takeaway: Outside of the US and China, India is easily the most vibrant place for entrepreneurs today. A stable government and the ability to reach tens and hundreds of millions — that’s our superpower.
