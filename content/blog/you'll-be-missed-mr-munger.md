"I had written this about Mr. Charlie Munger in last year's business update. His ideas have had a tremendous influence on me professionally. Youâ€™ll be missed, Mr. Munger. ðŸ–¤"

I have been reading and listening to quite a bit of Charlie Munger over the last few days. Every time I go down this rabbit hole, I tend to discover more about myself and what I think Zerodha should be. If I had to summarise, I could use some of his quotes (link to full post in comments)

One of the greatest ways to avoid trouble is to keep it simpleâ€¦ the system often goes out of control.

I would argue that passion is more important than brainpower.

Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets and can be lost in a heartbeat.

To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people.

Is there such a thing as a cheerful pessimist? Thatâ€™s what I am.

The best thing a human can do is to help another human being know more.

Assume life will be really tough, and then ask if you can handle it. If the answer is yes, youâ€™ve won.
