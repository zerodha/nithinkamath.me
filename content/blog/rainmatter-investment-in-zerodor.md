We have been using Zerodor [@EkamEco](https://x.com/ekameco?s=21&t=UlLwbUij830BIu7fmvFyoA) for the men’s urinals at our offices for the last six months or so. Our water bills are down 50%—we did not expect it to be this much.

It seems like a no-brainer for offices, restaurants, etc., where we have managed washrooms. 

They were on [@sharktankindia](https://x.com/sharktankindia?s=21&t=UlLwbUij830BIu7fmvFyoA) around a year back. Here is how it works.

We liked the product because they are doing whatever is necessary to preserve water, which has become supercritical. We are supporting them through [@Rainmatterin](https://x.com/rainmatterin?s=21&t=UlLwbUij830BIu7fmvFyoA).
