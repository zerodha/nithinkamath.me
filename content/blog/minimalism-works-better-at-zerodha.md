description: The core of our philosophy...

---

With everybody chasing "engagement," we seem to have made many things on the internet annoying and unusable. My own phone is constantly on silent because of annoying calls, notifications, emails, etc.

From day one of Zerodha, "don't do unto others what you don't want done unto you" has been at the core of our philosophy. We don't send an email or a notification unless it's important. Counter-intuitively, this is why people trust us? 

Not triggering users to trade hurts the business, but in the long run, it's good for the customers.

K calls this "user disengagement" and [explains it better](https://zerodha.tech/blog/user-disengagement/) than I can.
