Alert triggers an order (ATO) was on our to-do list for a long time, and we just launched it on Kite web.

ATO orders allow you to execute trades based on If This Then That conditions. 

For example, buy Reliance if Nifty 50 crosses 25000 or execute a nifty short straddle (sell a call and put option of the same strike) if Nifty 50 falls to 24975.

ATO will soon be available on Kite mobile. Link to the [Z-Connect post](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/business-updates/introducing-alert-triggers-order-ato-feature-on-kite).
