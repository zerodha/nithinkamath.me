NSE's new retail algo trading circular is finally out. Here are the highlights:

For individual traders who code: You can now automate strategies up to 10 orders/second with just a static IP for your API key - no registration needed! Beyond that threshold, you'll need to register with the exchange.

For algo vendors: You'll need to register with exchanges to partner with brokers, but once registered, your users won't need individual static IPs. All strategies need exchange registration regardless of order frequency.

For brokers like us: We can offer pre-approved algos directly on our platforms, providing more user-friendly automation options.

We [@zerodhaonline](https://x.com/zerodhaonline) have offered APIs for retail users and startups on http://kite.trade for Rs 2000 per month. With this new clarity, the regulatory risk in offering the product is greatly reduced, and so weâ€™re bringing the price down to Rs 500 per month for the data (real-time + historical) APIs. The order placement and account management APIs (view holdings, positions, etc.) have been made free since March of 2025.
