In FY25, around 72% of taxpayers chose the New Tax Regime. At Zerodha, that number was over 90%.

This shift makes sense. The new tax regime trades deductions for simpler filing and lower tax rates. For many—especially younger salaried taxpayers, avoiding paperwork-heavy exemptions matters more than maximising deductions.

With most deductions removed, salaried employees are left with the ₹75,000 standard deduction and one meaningful tax-saving option: the employer contribution to NPS, commonly called Corporate NPS.

Corporate NPS allows employers to contribute up to 14% of an employee’s basic salary (up to ₹7.5 lakh a year), which is fully deductible. It can be structured from existing salary, so employers don’t have to pay extra while employees still get the tax benefit. Employers may also choose to contribute on top, but it isn’t mandatory.

We’ve partnered with [PensionBox](https://pensionbox.in/workplace-pension) to make Corporate NPS fully digital, simplifying onboarding for HR teams and allowing employees to easily choose contribution levels and equity–debt allocation.
