Itâ€™s been 10 years since we started [Varsity](https://zerodha.com/varsity/). What began as a simple blog has gradually grown into a full-fledged stock market education initiative. Today, Varsity spans text, video, audio, and our latest additionâ€”a live format called Varsity Live. Itâ€™s an interactive, live education program and the first of its kind.

When we started, [Karthik Rangappa](https://x.com/karthikrangappa)
 and I decided that Varsity would have no agenda. There would be no pitching of Zerodha to Varsity users, no mandatory login, or anything else. Ten years later, weâ€™re proud to say weâ€™ve stuck to the original principle.
We have over two million users on Varsity, and we still donâ€™t know if they even have Zerodha accounts. ðŸ˜¬

By the way, hereâ€™s the [link](https://t.co/qE4I8HrMSy) to Varsity Live. If youâ€™re interested, thereâ€™s a course starting tomorrow.
