Despite all the discussions about the Indian derivative turnover, we are barely 25% of US premiums.

Btw, these numbers don't give you a full picture of the crazy levels of gambling and speculation in the US. Outside the exchange-traded derivatives, people can gamble on leveraged ETFs (these are massive), crypto, prediction markets like Polymarket, sports betting and other things.

When you look at what's happening in the US and then look at India, our markets look so sane.
