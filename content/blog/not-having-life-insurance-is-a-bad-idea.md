description: Things you should know before...

The first thing you should do when you are starting your personal finance journey is to ensure you have sufficient life and health insurance. If you have dependents, not having life insurance is a bad idea.

Based on my interactions with folks, perhaps the biggest reason why they don't have life insurance is because the policies are a nightmare to understand with all sorts of jargon and hidden clauses.

Then there's the fact that insurers keep changing things. For example, I didn't know underwriting rules had become much tougher and rejections had gone up.

So, I asked [Shrehith Karkera](https://x.com/ShrehithK) from [Ditto](https://x.com/joinditto) to write a post on things you should know before buying life insurance in 2025. Check out the link [here](https://t.co/OFffHMOZx2).
