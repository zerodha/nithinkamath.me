Almost all food packaging that resembles paper or cardboard, such as coffee cups, takeout boxes, and food wrappers, has a thin plastic coating. This plastic isn't just bad for the planet; it leaches microplastics directly into your food and body.

[Zerocircle](https://x.com/GoZerocircle) (a Rainmatter Climate investment) makes coatings from 100% natural compounds. No plastic, no microplastics.

Solutions like this can only go mainstream with public awareness. Most people are unaware that a "paper" cup isn't entirely made of paper. Once you see the problem, you can't unsee it, and you start demanding alternatives.
