Imagine this:

You get an unexpected call from a courier company. The representative tells you that the police have held a parcel of yours because it has drugs and other illegal items. They even disclose some personal details, like your Aadhaar number, etc. Soon, you'll also get calls from police, CBI, etc.

This is the beginning of courier scams that have just exploded in recent years. These scams are so realistic that most of us would probably fall for them regardless of how smart we are because they take advantage of our fears.

Every day, hundreds of people lose lakhs of their hard-earned money to these scams. Recently, the Zero1 team spoke to an actual scammer and recorded the call to break down and explain how this scam works. Watch it and share it with your friends and family.
