One of the biggest challenges in building a financial services business is that the incentives are often skewed toward doing what’s good for the business and not for the customer. It’s very hard to consistently put customers first.

This is one of the main reasons why finance apps are full of dark patterns, more than almost any other category. Dark patterns are design tricks used in apps and websites to make you do things that are not in your best interest. From pointless “gamification” and casino-like features to manipulative notifications, lack of transparency, and pushing harmful financial products, many platforms are, in some ways, incentivised to work against their own users.

“Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome.” - Charlie Munger
