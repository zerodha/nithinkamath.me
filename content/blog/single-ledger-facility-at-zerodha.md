Now, you can trade commodities using the same equity account balance without maintaining a separate commodity account. This was a legacy issue that took us a long time to address. 

Zerodha Broking is our primary membership, and Zerodha Commodities Pvt Ltd is the commodity member. We have started allowing customers to move to Zerodha Broking even if they are trading commodities. 

As part of this process, we are also surrendering the Zerodha Commodities Pvt Ltd license on exchanges where we weren't active, i.e., the NSE. You can trade NSE commodities as well using the same equity account. 

Since we are surrendering the commodity license under Zerodha Commodities Pvt Ltd, you would have seen a notice in the paper.
