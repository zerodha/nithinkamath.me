One of the issues with fitness is that gyms and similar facilities feel boring for a lot of people. I've always said that a better way to stay fit is to play a sport you enjoy because it won't feel like a chore. Sports are also more accessible for a lot of people.

With this in mind, we've supported many sports-focused startups that are trying to get more Indians to pick up a sport through [Rainmatter](https://x.com/rainmatterin).

Some of the startups that we are supporting:

[Game Theory](https://x.com/gametheoryindia) and [Machaxi](https://x.com/hello_machaxi) building coaching centres and venues for various sports

Spectacom ([DevilsCircuit](https://x.com/DevilsCircuit) & Yodha) and Yoska ([IRONMAN Triathlon](https://x.com/IRONMANtri), Hyrox, Duathlons): creating participatory sports events.

Fitpage (running) and Sisters in Sweat (women in sports): fostering community-led sports movements.

[OGQ](https://x.com/OGQ_India), [GoSports Foundation](https://x.com/GoSportsVoices), and [Simply SPort Foundation](https://x.com/_SimplySport): supporting promising athletes through sports foundations
