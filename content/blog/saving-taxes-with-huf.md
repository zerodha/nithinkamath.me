A friend was asking me about taxation for Hindu Undivided Families (HUF). 

If you're married and a Hindu, you can use a HUF to plan and save your taxes. HUF is treated as a separate entity, so all these deductions will apply separately to HUF along with the individual deductions.

So, transferring any property yielding rental income to the HUF, opening a Demat account in the HUF name, transferring money to the HUF bank account, accepting gifts, etc.

The [@Quicko_official](https://twitter.com/Quicko_official) team had published a video and a blog explaining how you can use a HUF for planning and saving taxes if you are married.
