Tracking the accumulation of open interest (OI) at different strikes can give you insight into market directions. The idea traders have is that option writers have deeper pockets, and if OI is building up at certain strikes, they can act as support or resistance.

Tracking OI across strikes is easier now as you can visualize OI on price charts by [Sensibull](https://twitter.com/BeSensibull) which can be accessed through the Zerodha account. 

Here is a post by [Abid Hassan](https://twitter.com/abidsensibull) on this and some other [new features on Sensibull](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/popular/introducing-open-interest-on-tradingview-chart-and-more).
