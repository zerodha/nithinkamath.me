description: Launching Money Mindful..

---

Despite all the interest in the stock market after COVID, there are still only 5 crore unique mutual fund investors. I've said this earlier as wellâ€”one of the biggest challenges for the Indian markets is the lack of an advisory ecosystem with just about 900 RIAs. 

If you consider mutual fund distributors, there are about 2.7 lakh+ plus, but still not enough. For a broad comparison, there are over 27 lakh+ insurance agents. If Indian markets have to expand, not only do we need RIAs but MFDs as well. Moreover, it's tricky to make the RIA model work in smaller cities and towns.

Even though we only offer direct plans at Zerodha, we know that they are not for everyone. Which means distributors will always have a role to play. Being a mutual fund distributor is also a good career option for a lot of people. 

So we have teamed up with [Hansi Mehrotra](https://x.com/HansiMehrotra) to launch [Money Mindful](https://t.co/dfaLsy6xZZ), a free video series to help you prepare for the NISM distributor exam and then start your career. We've also partnered with [AssetPlus](https://x.com/AssetPlusApp) which helps distributors start their business once they pass the exam through Rainmatter.
