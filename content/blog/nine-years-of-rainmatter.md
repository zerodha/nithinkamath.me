description: climate and health will be..

---

At [Rainmatter](https://x.com/Rainmatterin) we invested about Rs 275 crores in 47 startups last year. It may seem like we're investing in too many startups, but we aren't a typical VC and don't function like one. We don't take board seats, have no exit clauses, and have a perennial structure (patient capital)â€”that is, we are in it for the long term.

We may be early, but our thesis right now is that climate and health will be megatrends of the future. Considering that we think of Rainmatter as one way of giving forward, we want to back founders working on helping Indians be healthier and making the planet more livable.

Anyways, what is the use of the money if the planet we live on is destroyed and our health is ruined? ðŸ˜¬
