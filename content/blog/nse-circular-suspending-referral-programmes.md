NSE issued a circular last week stopping brokers from sharing any brokerage as a referral incentive unless that person is registered as an authorized person with the exchanges. This is another one of those circulars that will hurt the business. ðŸ˜¬

So, we are stopping our referral programme and making one-time payouts for whatever is due. But we will continue to give out reward points every time you refer a customer to us. These points can be used to pay AMC or access some of our partner products, like [@Tijori1](https://x.com/Tijori1), [@smallcaseHQ](https://x.com/smallcaseHQ), etc.

By the way, 12.4 lakhs of our customers have referred at least one client to date.
