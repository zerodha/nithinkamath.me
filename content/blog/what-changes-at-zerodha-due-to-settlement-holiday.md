Today is a settlement holiday, and thus, settlements of funds and stocks don't happen. This happens when banks in Maharashtra are closed, but trading on exchanges is open. 

Most brokers don't allow shares bought on Friday to be sold on Monday because of this. We [@zerodhaonline](https://x.com/zerodhaonline) are among the few brokers that allow you to sell stocks bought on Friday.

By the way, due to the settlement holiday, your equity intraday profit credits and F&O credits aren't included in your trading balance or are not available for withdrawal today.

And, Eid-e-Milad is shifted from the 16th to the 18th of September, and the 18th will also now be a settlement holiday. But the 16th continues to be a settlement holiday. ðŸ˜¬

Here is the [settlement holiday calendar](https://zerodha.com/marketintel/holiday-calendar/).
