I'm not sure most people truly understand the cost of transitioning from ICE vehicles to electric vehicles.
Are we just moving pollution from city streets to biodiversity hotspots?

Indonesia (~50% of the world's nickel) strip mines paradise islands.
Congo (~70% of cobalt) destroys communities with child labour.
China controls the minerals that make EVs possible: 90% rare earths, 75% lithium, 80% tungsten.
All of this is powered by coal plants.

There are environmental costs at each step. Are we truly considering all this?

Knowing us(humans), we'll always chase "better technology" over what's better for the planet.

Cleaner streets, yes. But at the cost of dirtier oceans, shattered communities, and forgotten islands?
