One personal problem I had was that there wasn't a good short finance podcast in India that helped me get a sense of the 3-4 major finance stories of the day. So, as an experiment, we launched a new [YouTube channel called Markets by Zerodha](https://www.youtube.com/@marketsbyzerodha) and started a short daily finance podcast called "The Daily Brief."

The response has been surprising. We just crossed 100 episodes, and it has become one of the most popular finance podcasts and newsletters in India, with nearly 1.6 million listens.
