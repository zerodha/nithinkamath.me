Cloudflare powers approximately 20-25% of all internet traffic globally. It's the infrastructure behind millions of websites and apps—from content delivery and DDoS protection to DNS services. When Cloudflare has an outage, it doesn't just affect one company; it impacts a significant chunk of the internet simultaneously.

Today, they had a brief outage that affected Kite along with numerous other brokers, fintech platforms, and online services worldwide. 

This is why we built [Kite Backup on WhatsApp](https://zerodha.com/z-connect/kite/introducing-kite-backup-a-whatsapp-based-emergency-mode). This system is independent of our primary systems. When external outages impact Kite, you can still exit your positions through WhatsApp. 

Only a few thousand people used the WhatsApp service today. Check out the post in the comments for steps on how to use it.

We're also actively working on reducing our dependency on Cloudflare. I'm really sorry for the inconvenience today.
