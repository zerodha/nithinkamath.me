13 of the world's 20 most polluted cities are in India. 1 in 5 deaths here are linked to air pollution. The economic damage is $95 billion per year, but this number probably doesn't capture all the first and second-order effects.

Premature deaths due to pollution are wiping out decades of earning potential. It has various downstream implications: lower working hours, lost earning potential, children missing school, stress on healthcare systems, and, not to mention, the disproportionate impact on the poor and vulnerable. Air pollution is a productivity tax on the entire country.

Hundreds of millions of Indian households still cook with wood, dung, and coal in poorly ventilated homes, and this is one of the single largest sources of PM2.5. The next biggest culprits are construction and coal-fired power plants. Remember, 70% of our electricity still comes from coal. We can't just quit coal; we're a $2,500 per capita country with big dreams of industrialisation.

Just because things are bad doesn't mean they can't get better. I know using China as an example is clichéd and annoying, but we can always learn.

In January 2013, Beijing experienced its infamous "airpocalypse", PM2.5 levels soared to 886, more than 20 times the WHO's safe daily limit. The smog was so thick that it became a national crisis.

Chinese people actually demanded change.

Social media exploded, people fled cities, parents sued local governments, and environmental protests erupted. By 2013, environmental issues had overtaken land disputes as the leading cause of social unrest in China.

The Chinese government responded not out of benevolence, but out of self-preservation.

Beginning in 2013, China declared a "war on pollution," setting binding PM2.5 targets for cities and provinces. They shut down or relocated thousands of small coal plants and heavy industries, such as steel and cement, away from urban areas. A nationwide monitoring and inspection system that combined sensors, factory-level emissions data, and satellite tracking was built to enforce compliance. China also invested heavily in renewables, electric transport, and cleaner energy, sharply reducing urban air pollution within a decade despite rising overall energy use.

In India, there's no political constituency for clean air. I'm worried we've become so numb to this issue that we've stopped caring. Yesterday's unacceptable becomes today's baseline, which becomes tomorrow's "not that bad." What horrified us five years ago is just Tuesday now.

I don't envy the policymakers. They're navigating genuinely impossible trade-offs: economic development versus public health, short-term energy needs versus long-term sustainability, current poverty alleviation versus future quality of life. That said, I'm hopeful that if we think long term, we can figure this out.
