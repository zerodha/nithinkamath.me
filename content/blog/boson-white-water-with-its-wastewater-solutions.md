It just took one bad rainy season for Bengaluru to face a massive water shortage crisis. Given that extreme weather conditions will only become more common, this probably won't be the last time we face this crisis.

I learned recently that wastewater could be part of the solution. Bengaluru's total freshwater demand is ~2632 (million litres a day) MLD, and it generates ~2000 MLD of wastewater. Of this, centralized sewage treatment plants treat ~1,300 MLD, and this water is used for agricultural purposes.

About 3,500 apartments and commercial establishments have decentralized sewage treatment plants (STPs) and waste ~80% of their excess STP water. This STP water is low quality and mostly unusable beyond flushing and gardening.
If this excess STP water can be converted to high-quality water, about 450â€“500 MLD of water demand could be met by decentralized treatment plans.

[Boson Whitewater](https://twitter.com/BosonWhitewater) is one startup we met that is trying to solve the problem of converting STP water to potable water.
