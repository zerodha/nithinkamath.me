Seeing calories, protein, carbs, etc., on a menu is a good start. Ideally, we need to see calories as a percentage of daily calories, proteins, etc.

One large chocolate milkshake has 1000+ calories, or 40% of an average person's calorie intake, which is about 2500 calories.

But showing that a food contains 40% of the total calories that a person consumes in a day might reduce the sales of a lot of things. Currently, only the number of calories is shown on the menu and packaging, and it seems to be making only a small difference.

Most Indians donâ€™t yet understand calories, but potentially, they could as a percentage. But yeah, one step at a time, and this mandatory display is a great first step.
