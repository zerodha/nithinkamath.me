description: LAS is ideal for those...

One good change from RBI yesterday: banks can now lend up to ₹1 crore against shares, up from the earlier ₹20 lakhs. Hopefully, this makes loan against securities (LAS) more popular.

It’s ridiculous how many people holding stocks continue taking personal loans or using credit cards at much higher rates—credit cards can go up to 40%+. Even at [Zerodha Capital](https://zerodhacapital.com/), we see this constantly. People just aren’t aware they can replace high-interest debt with LAS, which is one reason our book is still only ₹450 crores.

LAS is ideal for those new to credit or with poor credit scores to build their credit history, but again, awareness is terrible.
