Some important updates on Kite by Zerodha.

Order slicing – You can now easily place large orders without having to worry about exchange freeze limits.

Available margin – Instantly know your available funds on the Kite order window.

Market depth – Now easily access market depth on the order window itself.

Remember F&O quantity – Kite remembers the quantity you entered for a contract and automatically fill it in when you open the order window next time.

Market Protection – Makes your market orders safer, preventing them from executing at unexpected prices during volatile market conditions.

The new Basket icon lets you quickly build and execute multi-instrument orders from anywhere in the Kite platform with just a few clicks.
