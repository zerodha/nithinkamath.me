Seema and I recently took part in [India Reads Aloud](https://www.turningpages.org.in/about-5), an initiative by [Turning Pages](https://www.turningpages.org.in/) to foster a love for reading in children. 

Reading is foundational to curiosity, but given the structure of our lives, it's easier to hand kids devices. Once they're on them, the kids lose themselves and can remain endlessly distracted. Even I, as an adult, have a hard time not falling into the trap of endlessly consuming digital content. 

There's [emerging research](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/a-leading-neuroscientist-explains-why-generation-z-is-the-first-generation-to-be-less-intelligent-than-their-parents/ar-AA1VHuoh) suggesting excessive screen time may be impacting how children's brains develop, potentially making this the first generation to face cognitive disadvantages their parents didn't face. This should worry all of us. 

Initiatives like India Reads Aloud offer a different path, trying to make reading feel joyful for children and not like a chore. This is how you build lifelong readers.
