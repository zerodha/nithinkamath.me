The pricier cities in India have worse air quality, and these are averages for the city; most places have a higher AQI.</p><p>On a broader note, according to <a href=https://t.co/pWc5RmvHLt>this article</a> in <a href=https://x.com/OurWorldInData>Our World in Data</a> pollution levels broadly seem to follow a U-shaped pattern. In the initial stages of a country&rsquo;s development, pollution levels rise dramatically and then fall as a country develops. This pattern seems to hold across the US, the UK, and even China.</p><p>But despite this, we don&rsquo;t have to accept pollution as a given because of technological advancements; we can do a lot to reduce the obvious sources of pollutants. Take the case of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). The primary source of SO₂ is burning coal, which makes up about 70% of our energy mix.</p><p>One obvious way to reduce SO₂ emissions is to install scrubbers in power plants, which helps capture sulfur, which we haven&rsquo;t done in India. Even though China continues to burn record amounts of coal, its sulfur emissions have gone down because of this. In India, both coal use and SO₂ emissions are still rising.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the same thing with nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). Transportation is the biggest source of the pollutants, and people in urban areas are exposed more to them because of density and congestion. A lot can be done with stricter emission standards, which have historically forced automakers to innovate with technologies like catalytic convertors. Another thing that helps is the electrification of transport fleets.</p><p>Historically, the U-shaped emissions curve took centuries. Thanks to technological advancements, this can be much faster in the case of developing countries like us.</p><p>Btw, pollution will eventually feed into prices. Higher pollution means more health issues, and insurance companies are apparently considering increasing health premiums by 10%-15% for people in Delhi. Now think about all the other channels through which pollution will interact with prices and inflation. This is scary.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1894019258981728312 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
