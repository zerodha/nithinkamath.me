There's growing evidence to show that air and water pollution [increases the risk](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/01/air-pollution-raises-risk-of-type-2-diabetes-says-landmark-indian-study-acc) of type 2 diabetes among Indians.

If the quality of life deteriorates, there will be a tipping point where people just give up and start moving from large cities to places with better living conditions. If this happens, it will cause serious economic damage from reduced tax revenues, falling land values, and further degradation of civic infrastructure among other issues.

Remember that houses and land are among the biggest assets people own in India.

I am framing the problem this way because we are more likely to react if something can affect us financially. While we shouldn't, we somehow tend to postpone concerns that affect our physical and mental health.
