While demand and supply factors (limited free float) are obvious reasons, there may also be technical factors at play.</p><p>One common reason why traders blow up is because of poor position sizing. In other words, how much do you bet on a trade.</p><p>You can be right on direction 60% of the time and still lose everything if you size your positions poorly. One oversized trade can wipe out months of gains. This is why position sizing is a big part of risk management.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/mysandz>Sandeep Rao</a> recently spoke to Tom Basso, one of the original Market Wizards, to discuss his approach to trading. I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=6RI6uNvqNKDoEcGY&v=lejqGzaqAvI&feature=youtu.be">the interview</a> and the one thing that stood out to me was how Tom&rsquo;s thinking on position sizing evolved over decades.</p><p>He started simple: risk the same percentage of equity on every trade, inspired by Larry Hite&rsquo;s philosophy that every bet should be equal in terms of potential loss.</p><p>But then came a silver trade with explosive volatility. Clients were calling, nervous about the wild swings. So he realized it wasn&rsquo;t just about the amount you could lose—it was also about the speed of movement. High volatility creates psychological stress that leads to poor decisions.</p><p>So he added a second layer: volatility as a percentage of equity. Now he&rsquo;d calculate both risk % and volatility %, then take the smaller of the two.</p><p>Then came the third refinement: margin-to-equity ratios. Some markets have deceptively low risk and volatility but require high margin because of sudden jump risk. By incorporating all three factors, he never got caught overexposed.</p><p>The result was a position sizing system that automatically scales down when markets get too volatile, protects against margin squeezes, and keeps portfolio risk in check. It&rsquo;s really interesting conversation. I&rsquo;d also recommend reading <a href=https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/position-sizing/>the Zerodha Varsity module on position sizing.</a></p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/2001963068520382805 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li><li><a href=/tags/markets>markets</a></li><li><a href=/tags/investing>investing</a></li><li><a href=/tags/psychology>psychology</a></li><li><a href=/tags/education>education</a></li><li><a href=/tags/varsity>varsity</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
