While I have stopped trading stocks actively, <a href=https://twitter.com/zerodhaonline>Zerodha</a> is by far the biggest trade of my life.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/nikhilkamathcio>Nikhil Kamath</a> is a much better trader than me. When we started, idea was he would trade & I attempt to build Zerodha. If it didn&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;d get back to trading. It did & Nik continues trading full-time. His trading profits the first 2yrs is how we could build without VCs.</p><p>The reason why we do what we do is that we believe that more Indians should back entrepreneurs by taking some risks. Investments that can create jobs & wealth locally, & can lead to more inclusive economic growth. Money lying idle in physical assets doesn&rsquo;t help the economy.</p><p>Apart from enabling Indians to invest through Zerodha, we&rsquo;re using most of our personal & business success to back entrepreneurs. We started <a href=https://rainmatter.com/>Rainmatter</a> in 2016 to help grow the capital market ecosystem by working with startups & doing whatever to help them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a bit clichéd but wealth can&rsquo;t make up for bad health. We also partner with startups working to help Indians make healthier choices. With <a href=https://rainmatter.org/>Rainmatter Organisation</a> we partner for-profits & non-profits working on climate change problems & creation of livelihoods at the grassroots.</p><p>Free & open-source software (FOSS) is the main reason for the success of Zerodha. We are constantly looking to give back not just by helping FOSS projects & companies, but our tech team also open sources <a href=https://zerodha.tech/projects/>all learnings & many internal projects</a>.</p><p>I don’t have term insurance because I have savings set aside to cover my dependents, which I cannot touch. This was possible only because I got supremely lucky, otherwise, <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/insurance-by-ditto/how-to-protect-yourself-when-a-single-event-throws-your-life-off-course>almost everyone needs a term plan to ensure the dependents are protected</a>.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1539570124579295233 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/investing>investing</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
