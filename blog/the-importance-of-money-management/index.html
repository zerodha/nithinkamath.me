Money management, which most don&rsquo;t focus on, is exponentially more important than buy/sell signals & strategies.</p><p>In the last 20yrs, I haven’t seen anyone who has kept profits from trading without good risk management. I know many who&rsquo;ve lost quickly. The fastest was a client, who turned Rs 1lk to Rs 2 cr in 2 days buying deep OTM puts in 2008 but gave it all back in the next 12 months.</p><p>There is no quick money that can be made & kept. The most important aspect of trading is to never be in a situation where a trade can cause more than a 1 to 5% loss of capital. Lesser the better. That is when greed & fear will lead to the least stupidity as well.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1493108665754460161?s=20&t=1dcJh1tcql1BVWO2KPsNUw" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
