Unfortunately, we have had two episodes in quick succession in the last two months, affecting between 5 and 20% of our active customers.</p><p>The issues on Nov 6th and Dec 4th were triggered due to edge cases with our external dependencies. This is no excuse, and I understand that, as a platform, we are responsible for all the issues you face. But I wanted to share with you what went wrong and what we are doing about it.</p><p><a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/tradezerodha/an-apology-for-the-two-consecutive-tech-issues-in-the-last-two-months>Read more</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1732017232153112627?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
