Yeah, for sure, but only when risk is compared to option buying. Since max profits are limited & losses are unlimited, if the risk is not managed properly, option writing can be, eating like an ant & pooping like an elephant.</p><p>For most naked option writers, the losses in a volatile month may equal profits made over a long time period. If you&rsquo;re writing options naked, risk has to be capped either in terms of capital allocated or a fixed stop loss of 1 to 5% of capital, the lower, the better.</p><p>Writing naked puts, especially in stocks, is by far the riskiest type of trade out there. Every day, there are a zillion things that could go wrong for a company—Macro & Micro. Given the limited rewards & unlimited losses, writing puts doesn’t add up in the long run.</p><p>The only way to significantly improve the odds of making money by trading options is by trading options strategies with a max loss. The odds of profiting & surviving are higher. And longer the survival, the experience gained can help become a better trader.</p><p>A good place to get started learning & trading options strategies is <a href=https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/option-theory/>Zerodha Varsity</a> and the strategies wizard by <a href=https://sensibull.com>Sensibull</a>. And&mldr; the stock market is the toughest place in the world to make easy money, don&rsquo;t trust anyone who says otherwise.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1509535621127499776?s=20&t=fU72J8jKh1bI7hS4XOhlMQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
