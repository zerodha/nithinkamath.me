What they have achieved is mind-boggling.</p><p>They have managed to grow and propagate over 2000 native plant species. To put this in perspective, growing even one wild plant species is extremely difficult. These aren&rsquo;t plants you see in a nursery, almost no one else in the world has done this at their 80-acre scale.</p><p>It has become one of the few places that is a real training ground for restoration, with over 5000 people visiting each year, including some of India’s top experts.</p><p>They plant species on trees (epiphytes, as shown in the second picture) that literally help create localised rain, which in turn feeds our rivers and aquifers.</p><p>What I understood was that there’s no rushing a forest back to life. It requires immense knowledge, patience, and being in it for the long haul.</p><p>We partnered with them through <a href=https://rainmatter.org/>Rainmatter Foundation</a> last year to support the School of Ecological Nurturance and expand their conservation and education efforts.</p><p>The kind of work that is easy to miss but is exactly what we need.</p><p><a href=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/01/kerala-india-rainforest-biodiversity-restoration-nature-gardeners-gurukula-western-ghats>Read the article</a>.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1941805602692362469 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/enviorment>enviorment</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
