Maybe 15 crores max! Here&rsquo;s why, with Fintech as a reference, since some data is available. I guess it is important to know this, so we can all be rationally optimistic.</p><p>I get puzzled whenever someone says India has 140cr people & only 9cr demat accounts (6% of the population), & this can grow to 40 crores (25% as in developed nations) over the next few years.
Almost everyone building an investing app seems to be sold or selling this idea.</p><p>Firstly, India has 9 crore demats, but they aren&rsquo;t unique. The unique count is ~6 crore. But active demats with holdings above Rs 10k is less than 3 crore. This is in line with the ~3.4 crore unique MF investors—despite the MF Sahi hai and other campaigns.</p><p>So ~3cr or 2% of Indians out of 140cr invest. Large opportunity? Not yet & not the right way to look.</p><p>ITR filings for FY 20/21 by income.
~4.8cr &lt; ₹5lks
~90lks ₹5 to ₹10lks
~43lks > ₹10lks</p><p>If people have to invest or spend more, they need to earn at least ₹2.5lks/yr?</p><p>If there are say 5cr more who earn ₹2.5lks+ but don&rsquo;t file ITR, max Indians who make >2.5lks are just 10cr?
Beyond 10cr, income starts dropping below ₹ 1lk. They can&rsquo;t really invest or have discretionary spending.
Now, 3cr out of 10cr is 30%, which isn&rsquo;t bad at all?</p><p>The other question for fintechs focusing on investments is how large can the audience that hasn&rsquo;t already invested be?
Remember, we&rsquo;ve had a bull market, mega ads, freebies, WFH, IPOs, low interest rates, & social media frenzy? If this hasn&rsquo;t got people in, what else can?</p><p>There are maybe ~20cr on UPI & user growth seems to be plateauing. But among UPI users, the majority (90%) of transactions are again from &lt;10cr Indians. This seems similar to the assumptions of potential users who can invest or spend based on ITR and capital markets data.</p><p>Assuming I am wrong by 50%, that total number at max is maybe 15 crores?</p><p>Growing this number is the real problem to solve for all of us. Yes, there is incremental wealth created, but that is only within maybe the top 2 crore Indians, easy to miss the fact from our bubbles.</p><p>To solve this, the focus should be to do whatever it takes to enable entrepreneurs to build resilient businesses at home. So that they create wealth, share it with employees, shareholders, & invest it back in the economy. From Infy to Tatas to tech startups to lakhs of MSMEs</p><p>Not every business is VC&rsquo;able or can be valued at $10mil, $100mil, or $1bil. Sustainability is more important than valuation. Misjudging the market size and opportunity, then setting wrong expectations and chasing valuations are probably the biggest reason why startups fail.</p><p>It is crazy how everyone starting a business today wants to be called a startup, and talk is mostly about overselling market size & valuations, but not about sustainability. I hope this gets corrected in this global reset. We need resilient businesses for India to do well.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1527213271295852546?s=20&t=KUd5f99R8fYzPjoV0spTgg" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/startups>startups</a></li><li><a href=/tags/fintech>fintech</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
