I don&rsquo;t think so. I think, if anything, brokerage rates will go up in the future. Here&rsquo;s why.</p><p>Firstly, in the US, brokers can earn in ways that SEBI rightly doesn&rsquo;t allow here:
Payment for order flow: selling customer orders to HFT firms.
Securities lending: Unlike India, stocks are held in the street name or in the name of brokers—they can lend them to earn.</p><p>Float income: Unutilized funds are transferred back to the customers. In the US, funds remain with the brokers—they not only earn interest but use it for working capital as well.
I think India is by far the best-regulated market in the world in terms of investor protection.</p><p><a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/rainmatter/the-race-to-zero-can-indian-brokerage-industry-survive>I had written this post</a> a couple of years back on why brokerage rates in India can probably never to zero because there won&rsquo;t be other sources of generating revenue like in the US.</p><p>A flat monthly fee model doesn&rsquo;t make any business sense. Many have tried and reverted. We started with a flat fee per order because effort involved doesn&rsquo;t go up with the size of the order in an online world. But effort involved does go up when a person trades once vs many.</p><p>Also, a brokerage is like an insurance business, collecting small premiums (brokerage) but incrementally taking risks with every trade. Stock purchases don&rsquo;t have a risk since 100% of the money is collected upfront, but all speculative leveraged trades do.</p><p>Apart from, of course, the business having to earn a profit to be sustainable, there also has to be a risk compensation to cover black swan events. One <a href=https://tradingqna.com/t/the-crude-episode-the-risk-of-running-a-brokerage-business/75479>event like crude going negative (Apr 2020)</a> can wipe out years of premiums or brokerage collected.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1491328007679934467?s=20&t=Jp8VYTU78al6ZYPbPPvvMA" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/broking>broking</a></li><li><a href=/tags/startups>startups</a></li><li><a href=/tags/markets>markets</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
