They had left their jobs, moved to the Nilgiris, and were working with rural women to build livelihoods through craft. We called up and offered to help. Back then, it was called Indian Yards.</p><p>Since then, they’ve pivoted to <a href=https://thegooddoll.in/>The good doll</a> and are bringing back old-school rag dolls. The best part is that these dolls are sustainable and stitched by rural women artisans who now earn an income working from their homes, balancing family and livelihood. Most importantly, the dolls come in brown skin, not the white ones made for the West.</p><p>We need more such businesses rooted in communities, meeting local needs, and creating products that are good for the maker, good for the buyer, and good for the planet.</p><p>It’s heartening to see them doing well and finally getting the recognition they deserve.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1957452387142045904 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter-foundation>rainmatter-foundation</a></li><li><a href=/tags/startups>startups</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
