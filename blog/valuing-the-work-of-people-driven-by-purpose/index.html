Many have given up lucrative careers to work for the greater good of society.</p><p>This “doing good” deserves far more encouragement. If we could even celebrate 1% of what we do as compared to startup founders based on valuations, user growth, etc that would be a good start.</p><p>Oh, and someone asked me to add, just because they work at a non-profit doesn’t mean they don’t earn a salary. 🙂 They do, but their incentives are very different from what drives most of us.</p><p><a href=#ZgotmplZ rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter-foundation>rainmatter-foundation</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
