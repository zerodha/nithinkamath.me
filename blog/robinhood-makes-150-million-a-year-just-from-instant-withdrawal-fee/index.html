Their cost to process these is around $35–40 million, which means a clean $100 million to the bottom line, and that’s just from instant withdrawals. 😬</p><p>As an Indian startup with some scale, founders dream of generating revenue like this from non-core products. Hence the rush to introduce everything: loans, insurance, payments, and other financial services. But nothing really works 😀 outside the core offering. It just shows how far behind India is compared to the US when it comes to customers willing to pay for add-ons.</p><p>By the way, I’m still shocked that people pay 1.75% on an instant withdrawal transaction. This really shows how broken the US banking system is. Even in 2025, there’s still no full-fledged instant payments system like UPI — most fund transfers take a couple of days!</p><p>For comparison, we don’t charge at Zeodha clients for deposits (thanks to UPI) or instant withdrawals. We’ve processed over ₹50,000 crores in instant withdrawals in &lt;2 years, at zero cost. 🙈</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1988200891342569475 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li><li><a href=/tags/fintech>fintech</a></li><li><a href=/tags/technology>technology</a></li><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
