Our 13th year was dedicated to streamlining, overhauling and refactoring the behind-the-scenes systems, and R&D, paving the way for several new products and features we have in the pipeline.</p><p>Looking back, maybe we didn&rsquo;t do a good job proactively sharing updates, which might have made you feel like nothing new was happening at Zerodha. We have shared <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/2023-at-zerodha>all the 2023 updates in this post.</a></p><p>Our mission statement as a business has evolved naturally since starting in 2010, when it was all about reducing trading costs and bringing transparency to broking. Today, it is about helping the customer do better with their money and manage their wealth holistically, not just in terms of money.</p><p>To help traders do well, we are working on having a bunch of nudges that will help traders avoid breaking the basic trading rules, which will improve their odds of doing well. On the education front, you will see more videos and podcasts through <a href=https://twitter.com/ZerodhaVarsity>Varsity</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@Zero1byZerodha>Zero1 (Zing!)</a>, Rainmatter, Zerodha, etc.</p><p>Through <a href=https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin>Rainmatter</a> we are helping startups working on helping Indians do well with their health and wealth. Through <a href=https://twitter.com/RainmatterOrg>Rainmatter Foundation</a>, we continue to support the social sector working on making our world a better place.</p><p>The overarching goal of all these initiatives is to help our customers do well holistically.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1742122786217443422?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
