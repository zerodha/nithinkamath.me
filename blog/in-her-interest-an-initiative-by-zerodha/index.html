Today, that number is about 30%. When I saw this spike, I was surprised and wanted to understand what had changed. So we ran a small survey among a couple of hundred customers.</p><p>Roughly 50% of the women use their accounts on their own, while the other 50% have their accounts managed by someone else, such as their husbands, brothers, or children.</p><p>The fact that half of the accounts are self-managed is a good start, but this needs to change significantly. We’re trying to encourage more women to take charge of their finances through <a href=https://t.co/lMYvlgBMy4>inherinterest.club</a> We’re also supporting <a href=https://x.com/ladieswholead_>Ladies who Lead</a>
and other initiatives.</p><p>If you have any suggestions on what else we could do, I’d love to hear them.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1960984614409003340 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter>rainmatter</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
