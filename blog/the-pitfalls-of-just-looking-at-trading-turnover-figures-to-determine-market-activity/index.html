But just looking at volumes & not unique users can be misleading.</p><p>Jump in options last 2 yrs is mostly due to intraday stock traders switching to options after intraday leverage restrictions in early 2021</p><p>~10% of active traders contribute ~90% of trading volumes, in mostly intraday cash and F&O.</p><p>Comparing trading volumes of traders to equity investors is like comparing apples to oranges or brinjals.</p><p>Until 2021, brokers could offer as much intraday leverage as they wanted. This made trading stocks attractive.</p><p>But once maximum leverage was capped at 5X, intraday traders switched to F&O, given the ability to hold shorts and leveraged positions overnight.</p><p>F&O volumes grew faster than cash volumes because the most active traders switched to F&O. But if you look at unique traders, equity as a percentage continues to be much more than F&O. Yes, F&O participation has increased, but equity has increased much more.</p><p>I think there is another regulatory reason behind the rise in retail contribution from 27% to 36%. In March 2020, due to COVID-induced volatility, the notional F&O exposure value at a client level was capped at Rs 500 crores to reduce risk.</p><p>This capped the position limit for institutions in derivatives at Rs 500 crores or ~6000 lots Nifty, which restricted the trading volumes of others except retail. This, I think, is why retail % contribution in derivatives has picked up in the last 3 years.</p><p><a href=https://tradingqna.com/t/how-does-f-o-work-in-india/143860/4>In this post</a>, I explain why you shouldn&rsquo;t compare only trading volumes and conclude that speculative activity is unusually high just because option trading volumes are at all-time highs. It is important to track participation by unique users as well.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1630197532637958145?t=u8St19U12WBLXrNCLBbxyQ&s=19" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/markets>markets</a></li><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
