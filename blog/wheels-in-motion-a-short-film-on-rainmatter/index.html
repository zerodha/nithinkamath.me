Even if a small percentage of experiments work, it is a win-win for the funder, social sector, the Govt, and the nation.</p><p>But for this to happen, the funder (CSR or philanthropy) should be willing to take risks similar to for-profit investments in startups. The investments should be made with the intent of giving the social organization the freedom to experiment and not to tell them what to do. We&rsquo;ve had positive results in experimenting with flexible investments with no strings attached.</p><p>As we near three years of working in the environment and climate action space, we reflect on our journey and look forward with hope. I&rsquo;m sharing this &lsquo;Wheels in Motion&rsquo;, a short film on Rainmatter by Faraway Originals.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1736773003269329248?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter-foundation>rainmatter-foundation</a></li><li><a href=/tags/climate>climate</a></li><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter-climate>rainmatter-climate</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
