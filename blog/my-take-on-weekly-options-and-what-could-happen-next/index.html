I am as clueless as everybody else. ðŸ˜ƒ</p><p>Having said that, I would not be surprised if they were banned completely, and/or if there is some product suitability framework that makes it harder for people to trade F&O.</p><p>By the way, as I&rsquo;ve said numerous times before, regulatory risk is by far the biggest risk for brokers like us. This risk is magnified even more because most brokers&rsquo; earnings are from traders, and they earn almost nothing from investors (like with us).</p><p>Check the image that shows the drop in exchange option volumes since weekly expiries were reduced to two. They are down by almost 40% in a bull market. Now imagine if the remaining two get removed. ðŸ˜¬ We&rsquo;d be back to 2019 levels more or less.</p><p>We earn nothing from investors, either as brokerage or commissions from selling mutual funds.
