We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.</p><p>There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person&rsquo;s disease. But that&rsquo;s no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.</p><p>The scary part is the rate at which it&rsquo;s affecting young Indians. If you&rsquo;re a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you&rsquo;re a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.</p><p>But the sad part is there&rsquo;s a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don&rsquo;t even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.</p><p>What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.</p><p>Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.</p><p>We recently covered this in our daily newsletter. <a href=https://thedailybrief.zerodha.com/p/indias-diabetes-crisis-a-ticking>Check this out</a>.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1859480011927142461 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/health>health</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
