In hindsight, it was obvious 😀 We were publishing educational content in text form on Varsity, Z-Connect, etc., but we weren&rsquo;t focusing on videos. We had become like an incumbent, not adapting to the times.</p><p>Since then, we&rsquo;ve put in significant efforts to publish high-quality video content on all things finance, and slowly but steadily, we&rsquo;ve become the go-to destination for people to understand finance and markets.</p><p>Our video strategy is the same as it always was: share everything we know and publish content that people will genuinely find useful, regardless of whether it helps Zerodha or not, and whether it gets views or not.</p><p>But since the world judges a video by views, and we have never done any performance marketing, our numbers over the last approximately 2 years. And this is just on YouTube, doesn’t include Insta, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Zero1ByZerodha>Zero1ByZerodha</a> - ~ 6 crore views
