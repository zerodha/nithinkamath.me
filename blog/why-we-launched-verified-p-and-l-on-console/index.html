Since the P&L is served directly from our side, there is no way to tamper with it.</p><p>By the way, a screenshot or video of the verified P&L page can still be tampered with, but there is no way to tamper with what appears when you click on the verified P&L link.</p><p>Thanks to Verified by <a href=https://twitter.com/BeSensibull>Sensibull</a>, which validated any single-day P&L and then our verified P&L feature, there has been a drastic drop in the number of people sharing screenshots and videos on social media platforms. So, it has worked as intended. Hopefully, other brokers will also offer a similar service to bring accountability whenever someone makes P&L claims.</p><p>One issue we have spotted with the verified P&L page is that people are cherry-picking dates to show when they were profitable. We have now disabled the custom date range option, and anyone sharing verified P&L can select the last 30, 60, 90, 180, or 360 days.</p><p>To know more, check out the <a href=https://support.zerodha.com/category/console/reports/other-queries/articles/verified-p-l>support article</a> for Verified P&L on our website.</p><p>Update: Aug 31, 2023</p><p>We are one of the few brokers that allow customers to enter a buy price for stocks transferred from other brokers to Zerodha for P&L and analytics. Someone pointed out that people can potentially game verified P&L by entering a lower buy price for transferred stock and showing higher equity profits in verified P&L.</p><p>So starting today, we have stopped showing the P&L for transferred stocks on the verified P&L page. This is because there&rsquo;s no way for us to verify if the buy price entered by the customer is accurate.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t matter for F&O or intraday equity positions because they cannot be transferred between brokers and we will have both buy & sell trades.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1696854528186863884?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
