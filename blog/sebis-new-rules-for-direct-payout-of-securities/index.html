This significantly simplifies our DP process, which today involves receiving shares for the entire group of clients and then allocating them based on purchases made, i.e., gross settlement.</p><p>And this is much safer, too. A broker from now on will never be able to touch client securities ever, which is possible today when you buy stocks and are not yet credited to your Demat.</p><p>By the way, another change that started yesterday is that you can use 100% of funds from sale proceeds for further purchases. Until now, you could only use 80% of the funds if you bought on the same day.</p><p><a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/business-updates/sebis-new-rules-for-direct-payout-of-securities-whats-changing>Link to the article which explains this in detail</a>.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1843506648004059392 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/regulations>regulations</a></li><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
