One way to ensure people in smaller towns learn a little about money is to teach people there. People naturally share knowledge given the closer bonds there, especially among women.</p><p>So <a href=https://twitter.com/karthikrangappa>@karthikrangappa</a>, through our education initiative, <a href=https://twitter.com/zerodhavarsity>@ZerodhaVarsity</a> ran a two-day workshop in a small town called Chikkodi near the Karnataka-Mahrashtra border in association with Pankh India and Svatah.</p><p>The two-day workshop aimed to create a safe space for women to discuss their specific financial issues and enable them to take charge of their finances.</p><p>Their goals were simple: saving for children’s education, weddings, and their future. They left the workshop with a glimmer of hope in their eyes and a sense of confidence that they could now make better financial decisions.</p><p>We intend to turn our learning and everything we used for training into a playbook that others can replicate elsewhere, either on their own or by collaborating with us.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsy5CWOL3yE">Link to the full video</a>.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1738141036222791862 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/varsity>varsity</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
