My question was answered in 2020, and the trigger was a global pandemic. ðŸ˜¬ In the 5 years since 2020, the Indian markets have grown more than the preceding decade and a half. This growth was across the board, no matter what metric you look at, from unique investors, turnover, new SIPs, IPOs, to liquidity.</p><p>In my 14 years of being a stockbroker, I can confidently say that the Indian stock market has never been more mainstream than it is today. There seems to be a transition after 5 years of the bull market but that is to be expected.</p><p>Given the transformation of our markets, there was no publication that documented this growth. We asked <a href=https://x.com/adatar>Ashutosh Datar</a> of
<a href=https://x.com/IndiaDataHub>India DataHub</a> if we could create a Yearbook and he said yes. That&rsquo;s how this <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/business-updates/introducing-the-2024-capital-markets-yearbook>first data edition of the Capital Markets Yearbook</a> was born. The idea with this Yearbook is for it to be the definitive guide to understand everything about the Indian financial markets.</p><p>In the Yearbook, we&rsquo;ve put together charts and tables of all the segments of the Indian capital markets across equities, debt, forex, commodities, asset management, and more. The idea is to give you a comprehensive overview of the Indian capital markets.
