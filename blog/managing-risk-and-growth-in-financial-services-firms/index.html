This risk is like a hanging sword for these businesses.</p><p>In a way, all financial services firms are like insurance businesses. They collect small fees on services while trying to avoid catastrophic events that can wipe out the entire networth bankrupting them.</p><p>The more time I spend running Zerodha, the more I appreciate why regulators ask for increased networth as the size of the business increases. This is also why it is essential to be profitable when running a financial services firm, so that the networth increases proportionally as the business grows. Otherwise, even minor goofs can lead to a company going bankrupt.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1726567526644031949?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/money>money</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
