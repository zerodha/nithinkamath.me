To make this easier, we just launched Kite&rsquo;s Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCPs are a new way for AI systems to interact with real-world services like trading accounts, for example.</p><p>With MCP, you can securely connect your Zerodha account to an AI assistant like Claude and do a variety of things like get portfolio insights, plan trades, backtest strategies, build personal finance dashboards, and much more. For example, the screenshot shows an example of a personalized dashboard that can be built using Kite MCP with your Zerodha account data. All of it is free, just like Kite APIs.</p><p>We are optimistic about this new technology at the same time cognizant about the potential risks. To quote K from a recent post he wrote about MCPs:</p><p>&ldquo;Strictly from a user perspective, it feels liberating to be able to access services outside of their walled gardens and bloated UIs riddled with dark patterns. It moves a considerable amount of control from service providers to users, but at the same time, it concentrates decision-making and mediation in the hands of AI blackboxes. What about errors and failures with real-world implications that occur in the midst of AI orchestration across critical services? How would those be debugged and traced? How would accountability be established? Will regulations and governance models emerge for AI-mediated automagical actions across services? Whether the long-term implications of MCPâ€™s viral, cross-cutting spread will be net positive or not, is unclear to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Link to <a href=https://nadh.in/blog/mcp-seems-viral/>K&rsquo;s post.</a></p><p>Link to our <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/connect-your-zerodha-account-to-ai-assistants-with-kite-mcp>announcement post.</a></p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1925137840868147302 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/ai>ai</a></li><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li><li><a href=/tags/products>products</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
