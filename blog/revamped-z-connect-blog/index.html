It reminded me of how and why we started it. When we started Zerodha, we couldn&rsquo;t afford to spend money on advertising. So, we figured that sharing everything we knew about trading, investing, and the capital markets openly was a better way to reach new customers.</p><p>At that point, it was probably one of a handful of finance blogs. Over the years, we&rsquo;ve published hundreds of blog posts. In a way, the archives tell you the history of Indian markets and how they have changed since 2012. ðŸ™‚</p><p>The new Z-Connect will be home to:</p><ol><li>All business and product updates at Zerodha.</li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/ZerodhaVarsity>@ZerodhaVarsity</a> blog, where <a href=https://twitter.com/karthikrangappa>@karthikrangappa</a> and other guest writers write about markets.</li><li>Subtext is a new blog where we write in-depth articles about investing, markets, and the economy.</li></ol><p>We&rsquo;ll also start sending a crisp <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/subtext/a-few-good-things-on-money-and-the-markets>weekly digest with links to the best articles we publish on Z-Connect</a>.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1764946000639353209?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
