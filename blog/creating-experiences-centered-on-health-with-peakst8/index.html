If I could go back in time and change one thing, I would&rsquo;ve started focusing on diet, nutrition and sleep much earlier.</p><p>With each passing year, I&rsquo;ve been thinking more about health and fitness, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to encourage those around me, both personally and at work, to prioritise their health.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also realised that simple and repeatable behaviours make the biggest difference. It&rsquo;s not about running marathons, living in the gym, or doing Hyrox, or whatever. It&rsquo;s about making small daily choices, such as walking outside instead of doom scrolling, attending a Group fitness class instead of Netflix, opting for grilled over deep-fried, questioning the source of everything you eat, and more. These small decisions, compounded over time, can have a significant impact.</p><p>Most of us on the core team in the office are health-conscious, which has led to numerous conversations about how we can help others become healthier. That&rsquo;s when we started supporting founders working on making Indians healthier through <a href=https://x.com/rainmatterin>Rainmatter</a>. Given the current state of air and water quality in our cities, I&rsquo;ve been increasingly thinking about what more we can do.</p><p>The newest initiative we recently started, <a href=https://x.com/peakst8_club>peakst8</a>, aims to create offline experiences centred on health. The hope is that these events will encourage people to begin their health and fitness journeys. We&rsquo;ve been experimenting with different formats, and now we&rsquo;re hosting our first mega event on Jan 10th in Bengaluru, a full-day health festival with Rainmatter Health portfolio startups and friends from the ecosystem.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested, <a href=https://www.peakst8.club/festival>sign up for the festival.</a></p><p>But even otherwise, January is supposedly a good time for resolutions. But honestly? Today is as good as it gets.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/2003456813644284287 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/health>health</a></li><li><a href=/tags/life>life</a></li><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter>rainmatter</a></li><li><a href=/tags/peakst8>peakst8</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
