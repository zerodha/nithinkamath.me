Firstly, we think an IPO is the beginning & not the end. As soon as you have lakhs of conservative retail investors on your cap table, the obligations go up exponentially.</p><p>We are in a world where companies are getting priced to perfection based on all the future growth potential. For a stock to do well, you have to outperform.
As CEO, I dread to think how you can outperform the already really high expectations that growth companies have today.</p><p>We have never set revenue or growth targets, always believed that if we can do what is right for the customer & if goddess of luck smiles, the rest will happen. Our core team dreads moving away from that philosophy to be in a chase all the time, which it will be after an IPO.</p><p>The reason the chase is scarier is that broking has hardly any predictability. When someone asks me for a 3-year projection, I usually respond, can you predict what the Nifty Midcap index can do in 3 years as everything from our user to revenue growth almost mirrors that.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1459073986504003587?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
