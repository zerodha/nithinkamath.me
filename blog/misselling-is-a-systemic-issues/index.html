As long as you give revenue targets & push employees to get there, products that generate more revenue for the business over what is right for the customer will be mis-sold.</p><p>Easier for employees of banks, brokerages, wealth management firms to mis-sell as relationships are already established & there is trust with the brand, which is why the customer has allowed them to be custodians of their assets.</p><p>A potential fix is to mandate every sale of a product to be digital, even if this is being done in person. Mis-selling a product digitally leaves a trail and makes the company also responsible unlike physically where there isnâ€™t a trail & blame can be passed to the employee.</p><p>So if a 66-year-old walks into a bank, the employee selling has to mandatory enter a bunch of details into the bank sales app. Based on the profile of the customer, only a bunch of products (MF, Insurance, etc) that fit the risk profile can be sold and nothing else.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1377462026314739715?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/investing>investing</a></li><li><a href=/tags/markets>markets</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
