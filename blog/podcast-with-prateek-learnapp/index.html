Zerodha Varsity was our first formal attempt in text. But we knew that video was also important, & that people trust content delivered by experts.</p><p>This was the reason behind partnering with LearnApp through Rainmatter. The amazing bit in the journey has been that some of the best folks in our industry have been incredibly generous with their time to share their knowledge with no expectations.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s me in the new role of an interviewer <a href=https://youtu.be/lKLOTHQMurE>speaking to Prateek Singh, the founder of LearnApp</a> on his learnings from the journey building LearnApp.</p><p>You can <a href=https://link.chtbl.com/learnapp>listen to this conversation</a> on your prefereed podcast app.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1381105273574580226?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
