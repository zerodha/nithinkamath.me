A colleague got a call from a person claiming to be from FedEx saying that a parcel had been confiscated by the police because drugs were found in it.</p><p>Since he was expecting a courier from an e-commerce platform, he panicked. He then got a video call from someone claiming to be the police and issued this official-looking letter. They shared the bank details to transfer funds to release the package.</p><p>Since the fake police had his AADHAR number, this made the entire ordeal more convincing. This person panicked & transferred the money immediately. If this can happen to a person working in a company that constantly sensitizes everyone to cyber fraud, it can happen to anyone.</p><p>In a situation like this, the best thing is to say, I will get my lawyer to speak to you; it doesn&rsquo;t matter even if you don&rsquo;t have a lawyer. Most fraudsters prey on people who panic and react instinctively. Slowing down before reacting is the key.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1672249152875675648?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/scams>scams</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
