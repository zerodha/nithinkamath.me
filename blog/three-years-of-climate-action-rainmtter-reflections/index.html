As luck would have it, <a href=https://x.com/zenx>@zenx</a> was running a campsite on the land, and that&rsquo;s where we met. We hit it off almost immediately, and the Foundation was born.</p><p>Three years since we have a solid theme: chasing various intersections of things that impact the climate and the people and lives that it has an effect on. Be it in the space of Governance (rural & urban), Conservation & Restoration, Energy & Materials.</p><p>One of our strongest beliefs is &lsquo;Sense of the house&rsquo;, the need for a sense of ownership for the places we live in that will foster stewardship for that place. If enough people looked at it like this, the world is a place, and it will be better off for it.</p><p>Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_PQHjJfvEw">video on our reflections for the last three years</a>.</p><p><a href=https://ebtl.earth>https://ebtl.earth</a> is the restoration project that got this ball rolling.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/nithin0dha/status/1873969369514205483 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter>rainmatter</a></li><li><a href=/tags/climate-change>climate change</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
