A few transformational stories from my life</h3><div class=date>07 Apr 2023</div></div><div class=body><p>Today is World Health Day. Not that we need a day to remind us, but no amount of money can buy good health. Being healthy needn&rsquo;t be complicated; small lifestyle changes can make a huge difference.</p><p>I&rsquo;m highlighting some people who&rsquo;ve transformed with such changes in my life.</p><p>Venu is the man behind all operations & compliance at Zerodha. From chubby to the hottest compliance head in the world. ;)</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/karthikrangappa>Karthik Rangappa</a> the man behind <a href=https://twitter.com/ZerodhaVarsity>Varsity</a>. Slow, steady change over the last seven years. Full Idris Elba of JP Nagar 4th phase now.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/vishnus>Vishnu S</a> the one-man army behind <a href=https://coin.zerodha.com/>Coin</a> Transformed with small changes like eating primarily at home vs eating out and getting some physical activity daily.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/kmr_dilip>Dilip Kumar</a> is helping us with <a href=https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin>Rainmatter Health</a> He&rsquo;s also trying to bring health conversations into the mainstream through <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@theothersidewithdilip>his podcast</a> He now runs a half-marathon in 1 hour, and 22 minutes. ðŸ˜¬</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/adnanadeeb>Adnan Adeeb</a> the man behind Devil&rsquo;s Circuit, one of the few in the Indian health startup world who walks the talk. At 51, he can do more than most folks decades younger than him.</p><p>Have to add my wife Seema to this list, even though she has always been health conscious. She was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation. She remained in top shape through the ordeal. <a href=https://seema.page>Her story.</a></p><p>Good health is a foundational aspect of overall financial wellness.</p><p>It will be nice to have others share inspirational stories of regular folks who made the change to be a better version of themselves. It will be a good way to celebrate World health day.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1644243865036292098 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/health>health</a></li><li><a href=/tags/life>life</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
