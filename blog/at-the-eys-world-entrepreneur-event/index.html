And yes, I was “judged” for the first time since school — group discussions and all. 😬</p><p>I didn’t win. As Zerodha, we’re building only for India, with a single source of revenue. I guess the judges were looking for something more global, more diversified. Also, I’m probably too anti-social for something like this — public speaking, networking — especially harder after the stroke last year. 😬</p><p>But what really stood out was meeting entrepreneurs from 40+ countries. Different cultures, same challenges: How to grow the target market, how to get more active users, how to hire and retain talent, and do all this while still finding time for family 😀</p><p>Big congrats to Stina from Yubico for winning this year, and to last year’s winner, <a href=https://x.com/Vellayan_S>Vellayan Subbiah</a>— what a masterclass in public speaking.</p><p>My biggest takeaway: Outside of the US and China, India is easily the most vibrant place for entrepreneurs today. A stable government and the ability to reach tens and hundreds of millions — that’s our superpower.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1931602509824676263 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/life>life</a></li><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
