This was a way to avoid the temptation of &ldquo;trading&rdquo; my investments ðŸ˜¬</p><p>If I had to sell any of my investments, there was effort involved. I had to physically fill out the delivery instruction slips and send them to the broker to move holdings to my primary demat and then sell them.</p><p>The other advantage of having a secondary demat was, of course, taxation. If you have both short-term and long-term holdings in one demat, First In First Out (FIFO) taxation applies. Check the link in the comments to know more.</p><p>We wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/WSVmbSjiI_k?si=AP5KKpTi8oLii1rE">offer a secondary demat</a> for a long time, but there were some challenges, and we finally figured out how to do it. You can now open a new demat and use it to segregate your long-term and short-term holdings and smartly manage the tax impact on your holdings. This is a good behavioural hack to deal with impulse selling.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the best returns were on stocks that I held the longest in my secondary demat.</p><p>Link to the <a href=https://support.zerodha.com/category/account-opening/resident-individual/ri-online/articles/open-secondary-demat-account-zerodha#h_75148983470331755676330209>article.</a></p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1965710021217636706 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li><li><a href=/tags/products>products</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
