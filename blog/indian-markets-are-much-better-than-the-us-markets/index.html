A brokerage firm just enables this transaction.
In the US, almost all platforms are exchange agnostic. The broker just shows a bid, ask, and last traded price.</p><p>The order placed is mostly sent to a market makerâ€”typically hedge funds, that will either be the counterparty to the trade or send them to the US exchanges. They make a small amount per order and pass back a portion to the broker. This is called payment for order flow (PFOF).</p><p>These small amounts add up to billions of dollars a year for market-makers & brokers. This is how firms offer trading at 0 brokerages in the US.
In India, we can offer 0 brokerage for investing as we charge active day & F&O traders. Active traders subsidise investors.</p><p>Billions of $s earned from unaware customers. The SEC seems to be finally looking into this convoluted market structure & hinting at removing PFOF. One of the reasons why broking stocks have taken a knock.
Interesting titbit: Bernie Maddoff made PFOF order flow popular.</p><p>The logic behind PFOF is that it helps in better execution compared to orders placed on the exchange. It makes no sense because today most orders aren&rsquo;t sent to exchanges. If they are sent automatically, the execution quality on the exchanges will be much better.</p><p>PFOF practice has also meant that exchanges rely on charging for data to earn revenue, anywhere from $1 to 100&rsquo;s of $s/month/user. The more you pay, the better the quality of data. In India, exchanges charge for txns & we get access to same data on trading apps & at no cost.</p><p>Another weird practice is that by default, the account opened with a broker in the US is a margin account. Stocks are held in the street name of the brokerage, exposing the users to broker risk unlike in India where it is by default held in customer&rsquo;s demat at the depository.</p><p>The ability to fulfil the customer orders outside the exchange allows US brokerage firms to offer certain special order types & features. But that apart, our markets are much better even in terms of product offerings & not just because of better regulations & market infra.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1534840644858187777 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/markets>markets</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
