There&rsquo;s usually a third-party vendor providing the core order management system (OMS) and risk management system (RMS). Think of OMS/RMS as being similar to the core banking systems that Infosys or Oracle provides for banks.</p><p>The OMS/RMS is basically the heart of a broking operation. If this breaks, trading stops. Vendors in our business include Omennest, Kambala, 63 Moons, Rupeeseed, etc. OmneNest, which we use has about a 70 market share.</p><p>Many brokers are trying to build this tech in-house. We&rsquo;ve been working on it for almost four years now. It&rsquo;s extremely hard and complex. More importantly, it involves taking serious risks with your business during the transition. You&rsquo;re migrating live client positions while ensuring nothing breaks. One mistake and you could have trades going wrong, margin calculations failing, or clients unable to exit positions.</p><p>Constant regulatory changes make this even harder because they need to be incorporated into the system, and each change is a potential breaking point.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s much easier for a broker starting from scratch to build their own OMS/RMS than for one that already has established size and scale. When you have lakhs of clients trading daily, you&rsquo;re essentially rebuilding the plane while flying it.</p><p>Also, it&rsquo;s hard to make tough decisions about important things like this when the incentives aren&rsquo;t aligned. For almost every business using vendors, the debate is: Why bother with the time, effort, and risk to business continuity when no one really cares if you&rsquo;re running the complete tech stack or not? Clients don&rsquo;t ask. And vendor costs haven&rsquo;t caught up with the phenomenal growth in brokers over the last five years either, so the immediate financial case isn&rsquo;t obvious.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/2003043461034053634?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li><li><a href=/tags/technology>technology</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
