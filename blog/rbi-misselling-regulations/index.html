Customers walking into banks often get sold all sorts of financial products they don&rsquo;t need or understand. Products like insurance and mutual funds are bundled with other products like loans. Then there are all sorts of dark patterns.</p><p>So now banks have to ask for your feedback on the products they sell within 30 days, and if you think you&rsquo;ve been mis-sold, you can file a complaint within that period and get a full refund.</p><p>Btw, here&rsquo;s a half tongue-in-cheek, galaxy-brained counterpoint from a colleague:</p><p>~50% of household financial assets are now in insurance/pension products and mutual fund investments. If not for mis-selling, would they have entered these markets on their own? Probably not. Mis-selling has done more for financial inclusion than all the financial literacy initiatives put together. Everybody in finance knows this but can&rsquo;t admit openly😬</p><p>On a serious note, if financial education works to a limited extent and only greed (bull markets) and mis-selling work to get people into the markets, what can we do to change this?</p><p><a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=62207">Link to RBI press release</a>.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/2022295498036846818?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/regulations>regulations</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
