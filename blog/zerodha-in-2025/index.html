Also our product has evolved over the last 10 years, I donâ€™t think it would make sense to attempt to beat the best today on day 1 of the business.</p><p>I would have probably built a brokerage with some other moat. Charge higher and offer better research, maybe. Of course, the customers would have been much fewer, but you could still earn significantly.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1912401005557535179 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
