But there&rsquo;s something nobody&rsquo;s talking about: there is no real risk model in play for brokers. 😬</p><p>Regulations allow up to 5X leverage (20% margin) on many stocks. Competition forces every broker to offer maximum permissible leverage. If you don&rsquo;t, you lose business. Classic race to the bottom.</p><p>Unlike F&O, MTF has several risk multipliers:
Clients hold positions for months vs days
1,300 stocks (many illiquid) allowed vs only the top 200 in F&O
All buy positions vs two-way flow in F&O, making risk management much harder
Much harder to manage risk, given all the above.</p><p>By the way, this leverage from MTF becomes insane when you accept stocks as collateral. So, with Rs 1 lakh of stocks, you get a collateral margin of Rs 80k (20% haircut), and with this Rs 80k, you could buy Rs 5 lakh of MTF.</p><p>The structural problem: Indian equities have decent liquidity when markets rise, but it completely dries up during drawdowns. Minimal short-selling (SLB) means almost no natural bid when things reverse. Forced liquidations become self-reinforcing, especially in non-F&O stocks.</p><p>SEBI caps MTF at 50% of broker networth + borrowings (or up to 5x networth) to prevent broker defaults. But this potentially protects the system from broker failures, not brokers from client defaults.</p><p>With MTF growing 5X across the industry and everyone at maximum leverage, the next major correction could trigger synchronized liquidations.</p><p>We haven&rsquo;t seen a 2008, 2015, or COVID-type event since MTF scaled up. When we do, it will cause mayhem—not because any broker fails, but because forced selling into illiquid markets will cascade.</p><p>This will be significantly worse beyond the top 200-300 stocks due to lower liquidity.
Someone asked me what the risk model is. I said there is none. I mean, there is—if &ldquo;praying&rdquo; that stocks don&rsquo;t fall counts as a model. 😃</p><p>My gut says a lot of what&rsquo;s being earned as interest income, and possibly some capital, of brokers, will all be given back when the market does a quick move down.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/2013897219808862650 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li><li><a href=/tags/products>products</a></li><li><a href=/tags/money>money</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
