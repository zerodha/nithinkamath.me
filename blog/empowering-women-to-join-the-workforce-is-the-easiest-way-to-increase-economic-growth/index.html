Our female labor force participation rate is among the lowest in the world. One thing I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of is why our female labor force participation (FLFP), which was in the ~30% range in the 90s, fell to 20% and rose to 24%. We have been discussing this topic on the <a href=https://grove.rainmatter.org/t/womens-labour-force-participation-in-india-why-is-it-so-low/2331>Rainmatter Grove</a> and and Ashutosh from <a href=indiadatahub.com/>IndiaDataHub</a> shared something interesting:</p><p>&ldquo;The relationship between female labour participation and per capita GDP tends to be U-shaped. This is because at lower income levels, a large part of female employment (and the same holds for children) tends to be distress or need-driven. As income levels rise, this distress employment reduces, and thus female labour participation declines. And then it rises as women enter the labour force again, not due to distress, but voluntarily.&rdquo;</p><p>Check the images, the U shape (of course, with exceptions) and the FLFP % dip from the 90&rsquo;s.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1695301585767698446?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/economy>economy</a></li><li><a href=/tags/startups>startups</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
