It started with segregation of client funds, compulsory quarterly bank runs on brokers (quarterly settlement), removing pooling of funds for MF transactions, and more.</p><p>The latest regulation is around the direct payout of securities to investor demat accounts upon purchase. Today, when investors buy securities, they&rsquo;re credited by the clearing corporation to the stock broker&rsquo;s pool account, who in turn transfers them to the clients. With the introduction of new regulation, CCs will directly transfer securities to the client&rsquo;s account, bypassing the broker&rsquo;s pool. This also eases operations at a broker&rsquo;s end.</p><p>Another move which will most likely be introduced is around increasing the limit for a Basic Services Demat account (BSDA) from the current â‚¹ 4 lakh to â‚¹ 10 lakh. So, investors will pay 0 or reduced AMC on their demat accounts with holdings up to â‚¹ 10 lakh.</p><p>The reduction in the AMC is, in a way, a result of the gradual reduction in a broker&rsquo;s role. In the not-so-distant future, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if all that the brokers will be doing is just processing orders. ðŸ™‚</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1798975729675420050 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/regulation>regulation</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
