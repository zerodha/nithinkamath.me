The answer usually is no. As counterintuitive as it sounds, maybe the inability to easily enter/exit large public or illiquid private holdings forces fund managers to sit tight, which is also why they can outperform retail investors who are always trying to time the market.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1335159036639989762?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li><li><a href=/tags/psychology>psychology</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
