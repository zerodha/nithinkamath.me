Physical and mental health are among the most important aspects in life. You can&rsquo;t buy good health with all the money in the world.</p><p>I try to get a workout first thing in the morning with Seema; it also acts like our bonding exercise. ðŸ˜€ A workout first thing also means I make better choices with food throughout the day.</p><p>As for the mind, I try to talk about whatever is bothering me. Postponing this almost always makes it worse. Having hobbies like music and sports means I also get to spend time with myself, which helps a lot.</p><p>We also get regular health checkups. Nothing in life can guarantee perfect health. Regular checkups help you spot issues early and act on them. This is the best we can do.</p><p>It was super fun talking about all of this along with <a href=https://twitter.com/nikhilkamathcio>the brother</a> on his podcast along with <a href=https://twitter.com/SunielVShetty>Sunil Shetty</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/mukeshbansal06>Mukesh Bansal</a></p><p>And yeah, Nik and I are are two different people. It&rsquo;s ridiculous how many people think we are the same personðŸ˜¬</p><p>Nik is the best trader I know, he manages public market investments at Zerodha, runs this awesome podcast, and does a bunch of other things. I run the business as CEO of Zerodha and manage Zerodhaâ€™s private investments through Rainmatter.</p><p><a href=https://youtu.be/6HE6d0lKh4o>Link to the podcast</a></p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1675499058595794945 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/health>health</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
