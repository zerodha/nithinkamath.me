Not having a volatile personal life makes life better. It also improves the odds of doing well personally and professionally.</p><p>We humans are social creatures, and we are hardwired to seek partners. But I don’t think a perfect partner exists. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, and relationships are about compromises. Having said that, sometimes people aren&rsquo;t compatible, and in such cases, ending the relationship makes sense. Everything else needs a lot of work but has a significant long-term upside.</p><p>Seema and I met while working night shifts at Ranjan Pai’s call centre called Dial M (Manipal group) back in 2002. It has been 20+ years of ups and downs, and the relationship has been crucial for whatever personal and professional success I have had.</p><p>Thanks, <a href=https://twitter.com/SharmaShradha>@SharmaShradha</a>, for nudging us to talk about all of this, especially after everything Seema has gone through in the last couple of years post-cancer.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/b4N0Or9z3mU?si=cGje9UnZJCII6b6Z">Link to the video</a>.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1731253419867070804 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/life>life</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
