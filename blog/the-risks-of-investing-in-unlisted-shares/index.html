The popularity of some of these unlisted companies, like NSE, MSEI, Chennai Super Kings, among retail investors, etc., is crazy.</p><p>Most investors think they can make easy money by picking these pre-IPO companies, waiting for the IPO, and making big listing gains. But it&rsquo;s not as easy as it sounds, and there are all sorts of risks.</p><p>Even if an unlisted company IPOs, its price can be below what you paid. For example, HDB set its IPO price band 40% below the last traded prices on unlisted platforms.</p><p>Unlike stock exchanges, there&rsquo;s no price discovery for unlisted shares. The markups and commissions are ridiculous. These platforms are also unregulated, so there&rsquo;s nobody to protect you.
Companies can go a long time without an IPO like NSE, which means you can get stuck without liquidity. Unlisted companies also make fewer disclosures than listed companies.</p><p>You are better off investing in mutual funds than trying to pick unlisted companies.
