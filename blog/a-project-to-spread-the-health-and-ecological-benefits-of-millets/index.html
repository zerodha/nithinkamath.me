It&rsquo;s healthier & tastier.
Most of us don&rsquo;t know that millets are also good for the planet because they consume much less water & pesticides. The reason why everyone should introduce millet & talk about it too.</p><p>The United Nations has declared 2023 the International Year of Millets.</p><p>As the world discovers the health and ecological benefits of millets, India can become the global millet hub and also create green jobs locally.
Millets were popular in India until the British.</p><p>Millets like ragi, jowar, and bajra are rich in micronutrients, fiber, protein & complex carbs, and antioxidants, and are gluten-free.</p><p>I knew the health benefits, but our team at Rainmatter shared the ecological benefits recently. Check <a href=https://grove.rainmatter.org/t/millets-vs-wheat-rice/1045>this thread</a></p><p>An added benefit of millets is that since they&rsquo;re produced locally, we can avoid carbon emissions linked to food transportation.
If millets are distributed through Govt programs & mid-day meal initiatives, Indians would get more nutrition & would also have less diabetes risk</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/RainmatterOrg>Rainmatter Foundation</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/TheLocavoreIn>The Locavore</a> have also launched the <a href=https://thelocavore.in/2023/02/11/millet-revival-project-2023/>Millet Revival Project 2023</a>.</p><p>The aim is to simplify cooking with millets, help consumers add it back to their diets, and help them understand its impact on our ecology.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1625496196419846144 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter-foundation>rainmatter-foundation</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
