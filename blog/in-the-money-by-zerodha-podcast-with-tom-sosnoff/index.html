This has to be the most common and costly trading mistake of all. Goes to show the difference between knowing and doing.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/mysandz>Sandeep Rao (musandz)</a> recently recorded a podcast with the great Tom Sosnoff, co-founder of Thinkorswim and tastytrade, on our new YouTube channel, and here&rsquo;s what Tom said:</p><p>&ldquo;It takes a long time to convince yourself to learn certain things—mostly because we all have big egos and our own ideas. It took me a really long time to realize that I don’t actually know what’s going to happen next. I used to think I had an edge because I’ve spent four and a half decades watching markets. I’d tell myself, “Nobody has watched more ticks in the S&P than I have over the last 40 years, so that should give me an edge.”</p><p>But it doesn’t. And it took me a long time to appreciate that I don’t have any real edge over anyone else when it comes to predicting what happens next. I do have some comfort in having seen just about everything once or twice, but that’s not an edge.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom has been trading for decades, and there are so many takeaways in the conversation.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2F&source_ve_path=MTY0NTAz&v=jstOWsWvbAU&feature=youtu.be">Watch the episode here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1992905561092813159?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
