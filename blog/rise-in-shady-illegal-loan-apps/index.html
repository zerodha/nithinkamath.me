Many individuals caught up in the web of these apps frequently resort to drastic actions, such as suicide. For every illegal loan app that&rsquo;s banned, two new ones pop-up. It&rsquo;s become a game of whack-a-mole.</p><p>What makes these apps disgusting is the fact that many of them deduct as much as 10% upfront. Then there&rsquo;s the fact that interest rates range from 50% to 100%, or even 200%+. It&rsquo;s impossible for people who borrow on these apps to repay with such usurious terms. But considering people who borrow on these apps are desperate, they don&rsquo;t notice the fine print.</p><p>Traditional loan sharks resort to physical threats to recover money. These loan apps harass people by calling all their contacts and sharing private photos and lewd pictures that are morphed.</p><p>I have always wondered: What if someone uses a new SIM and phone with no contacts, photos, or messages? What would these apps do to recover money if someone gamed this system? It&rsquo;s not like these illegal loan apps report to credit bureaus.</p><p>To know more about the nuisance of these illegal loan apps, <a href="https://youtu.be/aQxUtDg4AHw?si=83y6XRYAakJnPpyX">watch this full video</a> on the Zero1 (Zing earlier) YouTube channel.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1744330282269085875 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/money>money</a></li><li><a href=/tags/scams>scams</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
