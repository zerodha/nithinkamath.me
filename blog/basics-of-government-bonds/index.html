But we also get a lot of questions from investors about how Govt bonds work.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s understand the basics in this thread</p><p>The Govt needs money to finance various activities such as health, infrastructure, defence & other obligations.</p><p>So, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issues bonds on behalf of the central and state governments to raise money to fund these activities.</p><p>How are Govt securities sold?</p><p>The RBI conducts an auction where banks, primary dealers, mutual funds, and insurance companies bid on the bonds. A cut-off yield or price is then discovered at the auction based on which the bonds and T-bills are allotted.</p><p>How are Govt securities sold?</p><p>The RBI conducts an auction where banks, primary dealers, mutual funds, and insurance companies bid on the bonds. A cut-off yield or price is then discovered at the auction based on which the bonds and T-bills are allotted.</p><p>How does a T-bill work?</p><p>T-bills are issued at discount and redeemed at par or face value. For example, a 91-day T-bill worth Rs 100 will be issued at Rs 98. After 91 days, the bill will mature, and you will get Rs 100.</p><p>Unlike bonds, T-bills don&rsquo;t have any interest payments. The difference between the issue value and the maturity value is your return.</p><p>Here are the <a href=https://coin.zerodha.com/gsec>t-bills available</a> for investing this week. One common question we get is, &ldquo;will I get 6.5% for 91 days?</p><p>All returns are calculated on an <a href=https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/government-securities/>annualized basis.</a>
Once the T-bill matures, the money will be credited to your primary bank account.</p><p>How do G-secs and SDLs work?</p><p>Both G-Secs and SDLs are long-term bonds, and they are structured the same. Let&rsquo;s first understand how to read a G-Sec/SDL symbol. Here are the G-Secs available for investing this week.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take the example of a G-Sec—7.10% GS 2029:</p><p>7.10% is the annual interest
GS is short for government security
2029 is the maturity year</p><p>It&rsquo;s the same for SDLs:</p><p>8.64% MP 2033
8.64% is the annual interest
MP is short for Madhya Pradesh
2033 is the maturity year</p><p>If a bond doesn&rsquo;t have an interest in the symbol, that means it&rsquo;s a newly issued bond. The yield will be discovered in the auction and the interest will be the same as the yield for newly issued bonds.</p><p>How is the interest paid?</p><p>The interest is paid out semi-annually. It will be credited to your primary bank account.</p><p>At what price or yield will the bonds be allotted</p><p>The yield or the price will be discovered through competitive bidding conducted by RBI where institutions participate. When you buy a G-Sec on Coin, you are buying it through the non-competitive bidding mechanism.</p><p>The bonds will be allotted based on the price/yield discovered in the RBI auction. Since the price is unknown, the exchanges block an amount in your trading account.</p><p>After the auction, the difference between the auction price and the amount blocked will be refunded.</p><p>How do I buy the bonds without knowing the price?</p><p>The prices discovered in the auction will broadly be around the current. On Coin, we show an indicative yield to give you an idea based on the current G-Sec, T-Bill, and SDL prices <a href=ccilindia.com/OMHome.aspx>from RBI and CCIL.</a></p><p>What&rsquo;s the difference between yield and interest?
The interest of a bond is also called as &ldquo;coupon&rdquo;. When a bond is issued for the first time, the yield and the interest (coupon) will be the same.</p><p>Since all Govt bonds and SDLs are listed, their price changes. Yield or yield to maturity (YTM) is calculated to account for the price changes. You can use the &ldquo;YIELD&rdquo; formula in Excel or any other YTM calculator. <a href=https://t.co/Qd2VJ43xy0>Here are the steps.</a></p><p>How do I invest in Govt bonds and SDLs? <a href=https://coin.zerodha.com/gsec>You can invest on Coin here.</a></p><p>Can G-Secs, SDLs and T-bills be pledged?
Only G-Secs can be pledged, and they are considered as cash component.</p><p>T-bills and SDLs cannot be pledged. See the list of G-Secs accepted for <a href=https://support.zerodha.com/category/console/portfolio/pledging/articles/what-is-pledging>pledging here.</a></p><p>Is there anything I can read to understand more? You can check out this <a href=https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/government-securities/>Varsity chapter.</a></p><p>I have some questions, where can I ask? We have a dedicated category for bonds on <a href=https://tradingqna.com/c/bonds/34>Tradingqna.</a> You can ask any questions you have about investing in bonds.</p><p>Taxation</p><p>T-bills
Since all T-bills mature within 1 year, STCG at your slab rate will apply.</p><p>Taxation on G-Secs and State Development Loans (SDLs)</p><ol><li><p>Interest payments (coupons) from G-Secs and SDLs are taxed at your slab rate.</p></li><li><p>If the bond is sold within 12 months, Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) at your slab rate will be applicable.</p></li><li><p>If the bond is sold after 12 months, Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) of 10% without indexation will apply. There&rsquo;s no provision for indexation on Government Bonds.</p></li></ol><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CoinByZerodha/status/1592467723749318656?s=20&t=GL4KP69dfKeUjZg2ET8KJQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/investing>investing</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
