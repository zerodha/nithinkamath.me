But if we aren’t hopeful that India will do better, then everything becomes moot.
This isn’t to say we don’t have real problems. We do. But every successful country has had to deal with its own share of thorny challenges along its development path. What matters is how we respond.</description></item><item><title>Why a local election shuts India’s markets</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-a-local-election-shuts-indias-markets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-a-local-election-shuts-indias-markets/</guid><description>Indian stock exchanges are closed today for Mumbai’s municipal elections.
The fact that our exchanges, which have international linkages, are shut down for a local municipal election shows poor planning and a serious lack of appreciation for second-order effects.
As Munger said: “Show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome.”
The holiday exists because no one who matters has any incentive to oppose the market holiday.
It also tells you how far we have to go before global investors take us seriously.</description></item><item><title>Financial literacy helped these women break free from debt</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/financial-literacy-helped-these-women-break-free-from-debt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/financial-literacy-helped-these-women-break-free-from-debt/</guid><description>Two years ago, we met a group of women in Chikkodi, Belgaum. Many were in debt. Some had never thought about savings or budgeting. We spent 2 days together learning the basics of financial literacy through Varsity with the help of Svatah Foundation and Pankh India.
But instead of stopping there, we kept in touch and continued helping them for 2 years. Today, most of these women are debt-free. For someone from a low-income background, that&amp;rsquo;s true financial independence.</description></item><item><title>Check IPO lock-in period expiry on Kite</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/check-ipo-lock-in-period-expiry-on-kite/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/check-ipo-lock-in-period-expiry-on-kite/</guid><description>When a company goes for an IPO, not all shareholders can sell their shares immediately. Certain categories of shareholders like promoters, early investors and ESOP holders have to wait anywhere between 30 days to 18 months before they can sell their shares.
Since these are large shareholders, whenever they sell, there can often be a downward move in the stock price. So if you are buying shares of companies that IPO&amp;rsquo;d recently, you should track when the lock-in period expires.</description></item><item><title>The broking business has a hard growth ceiling</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-broking-business-has-a-hard-growth-ceiling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-broking-business-has-a-hard-growth-ceiling/</guid><description>Broking is a unique business because there&amp;rsquo;s a hard ceiling on how much we can grow and the rate at which we can grow. What most people don&amp;rsquo;t realise is that SEBI has set a 15% open interest (OI) cap at the broker level.
No single broker can hold more than 15% of the total market OI. This restriction exists to mitigate the risk of concentration from any single broker becoming too large.</description></item><item><title>Open-source projects from Zerodha Tech team</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/open-source-projects-from-zerodha-tech-team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/open-source-projects-from-zerodha-tech-team/</guid><description>The number of full-fledged Free and open-source software (FOSS) products and initiatives coming out of the 4th Phase, JP Nagar (Zerodha Tech), must be unprecedented for a team of its size globally.
All of these projects started as a way to solve problems we faced internally and were then open sourced. We use them at scale in our stack, and several large organisations and even government departments globally use many of these tools today.</description></item><item><title>A year of MTF launch and product growth</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-year-of-mtf-launch-and-product-growth/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-year-of-mtf-launch-and-product-growth/</guid><description>We launched our MTF product a year ago. Despite being one of the last brokers to offer this and without actively promoting it on the order screen or elsewhere, we captured ~5% of the market. But growth has plateaued along with the broader industry.
One surprising thing I have noticed is that customers don&amp;rsquo;t seem to care about MTF brokerage or know what they&amp;rsquo;re being charged. Our current brokerage is 0.</description></item><item><title>Interoperability on Kite</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/interoperability-on-kite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/interoperability-on-kite/</guid><description>A feature that many people are unaware of.
You can buy a stock for intraday on NSE and sell it on BSE (or vice versa) to capture arbitrage opportunities if you spot any. Just select the exit exchange from your positions page. Margins get released immediately.
And it can be done regardless of whether you are trading for intraday or holding a stock.</description></item><item><title>Volatility in silver prices shows why position sizing matters more than direction</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/volatility-in-silver-prices-shows-why-position-sizing-matters-more-than-direction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/volatility-in-silver-prices-shows-why-position-sizing-matters-more-than-direction/</guid><description>This is the chart of MCX Silver Futures. This type of move is what every trader dreams of capturing, but it can also be a nightmare to manage without a good understanding of how to size your positions. Especially when something moves ~10% intraday.
On a side note, there seems to be a sharp increase in commodity trading volumes.</description></item><item><title>Creating experiences centered on health with Peakst8</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/creating-experiences-centered-on-health-with-peakst8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/creating-experiences-centered-on-health-with-peakst8/</guid><description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve grown older, I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly health-conscious. If I could go back in time and change one thing, I would&amp;rsquo;ve started focusing on diet, nutrition and sleep much earlier.
With each passing year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking more about health and fitness, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to encourage those around me, both personally and at work, to prioritise their health.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also realised that simple and repeatable behaviours make the biggest difference.</description></item><item><title>Drawing regulatory boundaries between trading and lending</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/drawing-regulatory-boundaries-between-trading-and-lending/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/drawing-regulatory-boundaries-between-trading-and-lending/</guid><description>The exchanges reiterated last night that stock brokers cannot distribute any lending products other than those explicitly tied to trading (MTF). This applies even if the broker is registered as a research analyst. However, despite yesterday&amp;rsquo;s circular, brokers&amp;rsquo; parent companies are allowed to create a &amp;ldquo;super-app&amp;rdquo; where broking and lending happens side-by-side. This is permissible today because there are no restrictions on the parent entity.
The core concern is that any type of lending or inducement to borrow on a trading platform could lead to borrowed money flowing back into the markets.</description></item><item><title>Why most brokers don’t build their own OMS/RMS</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-most-brokers-dont-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-most-brokers-dont-build/</guid><description>One of the lesser-known things about stock brokers is that most brokers don&amp;rsquo;t actually own their entire tech stack. There&amp;rsquo;s usually a third-party vendor providing the core order management system (OMS) and risk management system (RMS). Think of OMS/RMS as being similar to the core banking systems that Infosys or Oracle provides for banks.
The OMS/RMS is basically the heart of a broking operation. If this breaks, trading stops. Vendors in our business include Omennest, Kambala, 63 Moons, Rupeeseed, etc.</description></item><item><title>Planting trees is not enough if they aren’t native</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/planting-trees-is-not-enough-if-they-arent-native/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/planting-trees-is-not-enough-if-they-arent-native/</guid><description>When we discuss rewilding and land restoration, ensuring that native trees are used is equally important. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of this when I planted Conocarpus trees at home almost 10 years ago. No birds or animals have ever come to the tree.
I also realised much later that these trees aren&amp;rsquo;t good for humans either. They cause allergic reactions in many people. It&amp;rsquo;s been so many years now that I feel bad about cutting them down, but maybe I should.</description></item><item><title>Risk management lessons from Tom Basso</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/risk-management-lessons-from-tom-basso/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/risk-management-lessons-from-tom-basso/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing many recent IPOs continue running up for 2-3 days after listing. While demand and supply factors (limited free float) are obvious reasons, there may also be technical factors at play.
One common reason why traders blow up is because of poor position sizing. In other words, how much do you bet on a trade.
You can be right on direction 60% of the time and still lose everything if you size your positions poorly.</description></item><item><title>Why some IPOs keep rising even after listing day</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-some-ipos-keep-rising-even-after-listing-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-some-ipos-keep-rising-even-after-listing-day/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been noticing many recent IPOs continue running up for 2-3 days after listing. While demand and supply factors (limited free float) are obvious reasons, there may also be technical factors at play.
Let me explain the technical factor.
Many traders attempt to short these stocks intraday, expecting a fall, but if the stock hits the upper circuit, they get trapped with no buyers to sell to. This leads to what’s called a short delivery.</description></item><item><title>What cleaning up pollution looks like when it’s done properly</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/what-cleaning-up-pollution-looks-like-when-its-done-properly/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/what-cleaning-up-pollution-looks-like-when-its-done-properly/</guid><description>I was watching this video by Rainmatter Foundation about how Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (Aurangabad) cleaned up the Kham river in 5 years. It had become a sewage drain, and they turned it back into a flowing river. Made me think about especially of Delhi&amp;rsquo;s air quality problem.
They mapped 249 waste entry points with drones and installed traps. Rerouted sewage to treatment plants and built new ones. Set up a facility for textile waste from factories.</description></item><item><title>Why we don't provide personal and credit card loans through Zerodha Capital</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-we-dont-provide-personal-and-credit-card-loans-through-zerodha-capital/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-we-dont-provide-personal-and-credit-card-loans-through-zerodha-capital/</guid><description>Someone on our team recently asked, &amp;ldquo;Why do we only offer Loan Against Securities on Zerodha Capital?&amp;rdquo; Why not personal loans or credit cards with their higher interest rates?
The simple answer is we can&amp;rsquo;t do anything different there. And our cost of funds doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. We&amp;rsquo;re at ~8.5%, while banks raise money at ~3.5%, and large NBFCs around ~7%.
Can&amp;rsquo;t compete on rates, and usually the best borrowers go where the rates are the lowest.</description></item><item><title>Protect your assets by adding a nominee</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/protect-your-assets-by-adding-a-nominee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/protect-your-assets-by-adding-a-nominee/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s ₹104,000 crores worth of money and investments lying unclaimed across banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds. The number is from a post by our PM Narendra Modi.
Despite the nomination process being fully online and despite repeated nudges, 62% of Zerodha users with holdings don&amp;rsquo;t have a nominee. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t added any nominees, it takes barely a couple of minutes.
While adding nominees is a good first step, you still have to inform the nominees.</description></item><item><title>Making food packaging plastic-free with Zerocircle</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/making-food-packaging-plastic-free-with-zerocircle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/making-food-packaging-plastic-free-with-zerocircle/</guid><description>Almost all food packaging that resembles paper or cardboard, such as coffee cups, takeout boxes, and food wrappers, has a thin plastic coating. This plastic isn&amp;rsquo;t just bad for the planet; it leaches microplastics directly into your food and body.
Zerocircle (a Rainmatter Climate investment) makes coatings from 100% natural compounds. No plastic, no microplastics.
Solutions like this can only go mainstream with public awareness. Most people are unaware that a &amp;ldquo;paper&amp;rdquo; cup isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely made of paper.</description></item><item><title>Why encouraging less trading leads to better outcomes for everyone</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-encouraging-less-trading-leads-to-better-outcomes-for-everyone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-encouraging-less-trading-leads-to-better-outcomes-for-everyone/</guid><description>As a % of client funds, our brokerage revenue is 20-25% of our listed peers. That means our clients trade a lot less (75% lesser) as a proportion of their capital.
Here&amp;rsquo;s something counterintuitive but true: With few exceptions, the more frequently people trade, the lower their odds of being profitable. More activity doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean better returns; it usually means a higher chance of blowing out your account.
So it&amp;rsquo;s actually in a platform&amp;rsquo;s best interest to get customers to trade less, not more.</description></item></channel></rss>
