On average, over 60,000 to 1 lakh people watch or read The Daily Brief every day.</p><p>Almost all of this is because people genuinely enjoy the content and share it with their friends. Honestly, I didn’t expect this when I first asked the team to start a daily podcast. What began as a small idea has now grown into something bigger. We now publish several other shows and newsletters like The Chatter, Aftermarket Report, and more. What’s even cooler is that the entire markets project is run by a bunch of young kids.</p><p>At a time when people are consuming less and less mainstream news, it’s great to see that we’ve become a trusted source of financial insights. Not just through <a href=https://x.com/zerodhamarkets>Markets by Zerodha</a>, but also through <a href=https://x.com/zerodhavarsity>Varsity</a>, <a href=https://x.com/Zero1ByZerodha>Zero1</a>, and others.</p><p>What still surprises me is that people are actually reading. Real words. Long-form writing. 😬</p><p>Link to the <a href=https://youtube.com/@marketsbyzerodhaLink>YouTube Channel</a> and <a href=https://substack.com/@zerodhaonline>the newsletters</a></p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1943630260588929336 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/interesting-articles>interesting-articles</a></li><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
