On average, over 60,000 to 1 lakh people watch or read The Daily Brief every day.</p><p>Almost all of this is because people genuinely enjoy the content and share it with their friends. Honestly, I didnâ€™t expect this when I first asked the team to start a daily podcast. What began as a small idea has now grown into something bigger. We now publish several other shows and newsletters like The Chatter, Aftermarket Report, and more. Whatâ€™s even cooler is that the entire markets project is run by a bunch of young kids.</p><p>At a time when people are consuming less and less mainstream news, itâ€™s great to see that weâ€™ve become a trusted source of financial insights. Not just through <a href=https://x.com/zerodhamarkets>Markets by Zerodha</a>, but also through <a href=https://x.com/zerodhavarsity>Varsity</a>, <a href=https://x.com/Zero1ByZerodha>Zero1</a>, and others.</p><p>What still surprises me is that people are actually reading. Real words. Long-form writing. ðŸ˜¬</p><p>Link to the <a href=https://youtube.com/@marketsbyzerodhaLink>YouTube Channel</a> and <a href=https://substack.com/@zerodhaonline>the newsletters</a></p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1943630260588929336 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/interesting-articles>interesting-articles</a></li><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
