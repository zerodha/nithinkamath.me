If you add impact costs, the minimum return an active trader should generate to break even yearly on their portfolio is usually well above 20%. Yep, that high and that tough.</p><p>Costs include
Statutory costs like STT, Stamp duty, GST
Impact costs or slippages (while this doesn’t even seem like a cost, it adds up quickly. Especially when buying options, will have a post on this soon).
Trading costs like brokerage and exchange charges.</p><p>This breakeven % is a high hurdle as most traders take largest possible positions every trade with their capital without considering costs
The way to reduce the impact of costs & increasing the odds of winning is by reducing the trading size (% of capital deployed per trade).</p><p>At Zerodha the statutory costs incurred are more than trading costs
~20% of active traders incur ~80% of total costs. This must be similar to most brokerage firms
Trivia: STT + Stamp paid by our customers is more than the Income tax paid by the 25th largest company in India.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1409470445242380293?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
