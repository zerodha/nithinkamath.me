So we figured, we were anyway trying to support Indian fintech startups building for India, why not do the same for health? And so
<a href=https://twitter.com/Rainmatterin>Rainmatter Health</a> was born.</p><p>The goal was to help Indian startups trying to make Indians healthier. It&rsquo;s been a couple of years, and in this journey, we invested over Rs 150 crore in <a href=https://twitter.com/akshayakalpa>Akshayakalpa Organic</a>, Two Brothers Organic, and The Whole Flour and more.</p><p>All these startups are trying to fix the food items that Indians consume the most: staples, milk, wheat flour, eggs, and more. We&rsquo;ve not only invested in them but also consume products from the same brands. A happy coincidence is that some of these startups are also working with small farmers and improving their livelihood. So yeah, all this started with asking questions.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1803003933830664411 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter>rainmatter</a></li><li><a href=/tags/health>health</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
