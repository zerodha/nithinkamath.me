The only way to protect yourself is to not trust anybody asking for money or offering something that seems too good to be true. Here are a few types of frauds I have come across recently.</p><p>Impersonating Govt officials and other higher authorities and asking for charitable donations or money for other things. Many folks on our team have received social media and WhatsApp messages saying I was in some urgent need of money from fake accounts.</p><p>Fake Instagram & social media profiles of well-known people are created by copying everything from the original profile. The followers of these fake accounts then get messages to buy paid courses, scammy penny stocks and crypto. Here&rsquo;s an example of my ID being used.</p><p><a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/tradezerodha/stock-market-scams-everyone-should-be-aware-of>Luring customers to share login credentials</a> by using greed. Once the fraudster has access to the account, losses are created and money is transferred to other trading accounts by trading penny stocks, illiquid options or transferring stocks.</p><p>The craziest one is fraudsters advertising the customer support number of a large company on Google. When the customer calls up the number, the scamsters ask for a UPI transfer or send UPI pull requests from handles that seem like they belong to the main brand.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1519655129313837057?s=20&t=O2LTO1fyk-sWOZKRhjCpkQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/money>money</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
