Not happening in most places in India.</p><p>For eg, if a flat costing Rs 1cr can be rented at Rs 20k/month. For the price to go to Rs 2 cr, ideally rent has to go to Rs 40k/month as well.</p><p>Of course, like stocks, real estate prices can also go up without good fundamentals. Usually when that happens, stocks, real estate, crypto, etc., prices don&rsquo;t stay up there for too long.
For real estate, rental yields are probably the best measure of fundamentals.</p><p>Real estate is illiquid, just like private market valuations. Real price vs last transacted price that sellers claim could be way off.</p><p>The other risk is since the price is fixed & paid upfront, you can&rsquo;t take advantage of price fluctuations through a SIP as in Stocks or MF.</p><p>Of course, buying where prices haven&rsquo;t already appreciated (in tiers 2 & 3, outskirts of a metro) can mean good ROI.
But this is like buying a small-cap stock hoping it becomes large-cap, only a few do. It is a high-risk strategy & hence capital allocation should be lower.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1544579381989093377 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/investing>investing</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
