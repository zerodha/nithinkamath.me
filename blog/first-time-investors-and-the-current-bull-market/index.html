The good thing is that they are younger and have less to invest. Meaning they can learn hands-on and bounce back quicker if money mistakes are made.</p><p>Historically, activity has always dropped sharply post serious market falls. Folks who have significant investments typically don&rsquo;t do anything in such markets. It will be interesting to see how the new young investors with small ticket sizes behave this time around.</p><p>IPOs have played a huge role in attracting these users. Without UPI for IPOs, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for non-bank brokerage firms like us. India Stack has probably been responsible for a lion&rsquo;s share of disruption and innovation in India Fintech.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1453374760730124298?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
