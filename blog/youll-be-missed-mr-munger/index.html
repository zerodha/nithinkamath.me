His ideas have had a tremendous influence on me professionally. You’ll be missed, Mr. Munger. 🖤&rdquo;</p><p>I have been reading and listening to quite a bit of Charlie Munger over the last few days. Every time I go down this rabbit hole, I tend to discover more about myself and what I think Zerodha should be. If I had to summarise, I could use some of his quotes (link to full post in comments)</p><p>One of the greatest ways to avoid trouble is to keep it simple… the system often goes out of control.</p><p>I would argue that passion is more important than brainpower.</p><p>Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets and can be lost in a heartbeat.</p><p>To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people.</p><p>Is there such a thing as a cheerful pessimist? That’s what I am.</p><p>The best thing a human can do is to help another human being know more.</p><p>Assume life will be really tough, and then ask if you can handle it. If the answer is yes, you’ve won.</p><p><a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/business-updates-increased-disclosures-and-improving-transparency>Link to the post.</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1729754628609151447?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/life>life</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
