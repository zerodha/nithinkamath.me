This is the answer to many of India’s problems. And now is probably the right time to work towards it.</p><p>Large cities are choking & will continue to break down every time we&rsquo;re tested, COVID today, could be water shortages, pollution, floods, etc. Moving to smaller towns & villages will also create livelihoods there & reduce carbon footprint. Also a much better quality of life.</p><p>The silver lining in these trying times is that people are more open than ever to move out of large cities. These <a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1385887036222050307?s=20">results</a> is from the latest survey we just had with our team at Zerodha.</p><p>We are in the process of transitioning as many people as possible to permanent WFH so that we can enable this move out of large cities for those who haven’t, & make it permanent for those who have already moved.</p><p>We are also now hiring for permanent WFH positions for our Customer support team & soon for other teams as well. I&rsquo;m hoping that other businesses who can, will also move whatever jobs possible to permanent WFH and nudge their teams to make this transition.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1385887029171425284?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/markets>markets</a></li><li><a href=/tags/investing>investing</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
