It had become a sewage drain, and they turned it back into a flowing river. Made me think about especially of Delhi&rsquo;s air quality problem.</p><p>They mapped 249 waste entry points with drones and installed traps. Rerouted sewage to treatment plants and built new ones. Set up a facility for textile waste from factories. Cleaned the river and discovered springs that were buried under debris. Fixed waste collection across the city, removed 170 dump sites. The municipal commissioner joined weekend cleanups himself. Citizens showed up every Saturday. The key was stopping waste from entering the river in the first place, not just cleaning it.</p><p>If a smaller city can pull this off in 5 years with the municipal corporation, NGOs, and citizens working together, I was wondering if governments, businesses, NGOs, and citizens actually collaborate, can&rsquo;t they make a difference in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and many other cities where the Air quality is really bad.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/2001161882871456118 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/environment>environment</a></li><li><a href=/tags/climate>climate</a></li><li><a href=/tags/climate-change>climate-change</a></li><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter-foundation>rainmatter-foundation</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
