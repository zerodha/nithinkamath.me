For a long time, almost everyone in my life told me to get a real job when I was trading and running a business until Zerodha became popular. I think this has reduced quite a bit in metros and even smaller towns, entrepreneurship is now real and the Government initiatives & messaging have played a part as well.</p><p>One problem I have had with the Indian startup ecosystem is that most of the wealth created has happened outside India. This is because 90% of the startup investments are from VCs with foreign capital. How can a country achieve inclusive prosperity if most of the wealth created from resources in India is generated outside?</p><p>This was one thought as we started thinking more about <a href=https://twitter.com/rainmatterin>Rainmatter</a>. Coincidentally, the Rainmatter journey started in 2016 as well, and we&rsquo;ve been partnering with and supporting Indian founders who are helping Indians do better with their health and wealth.</p><p>Our motivation was to provide patient capital for these startups to build sustainable businesses that do good for the country. I feel happy that we&rsquo;ve had some role to play in the 100+ startups that we have supported. Looking back, the number of founders that we interact with and their quality have grown exponentially. The future looks bright for the Indian startup ecosystem.</p><p>We are in a position where our founders can build global products out of India. It goes without saying that this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without the international VCs taking the risk, bankrolling startups in India, and getting us here. I hope that in the next phase of our startup ecosystem, more local capital will support local entrepreneurs, and we will reduce our dependency on outside capital.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1747242847152017419?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter>rainmatter</a></li><li><a href=/tags/startups>startups</a></li><li><a href=/tags/economy>economy</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
