This circular has a significant impact on brokers, traders, and investors.</p><p>Stock exchanges charge transaction fees based on the overall turnover contributed by brokers. The difference between what the brokers charge the customer and what the exchange charges the broker at the end of the month is a rebate, which goes to brokers. Such rebates are common across the major markets in the world.</p><p>These rebates account for about 10% of our revenues and anywhere between 10-50% of other brokers across the industry. With the new circular, this revenue stream goes away.</p><p>We were one of the last remaining brokers that offered free equity delivery trades. We could do this because F&O trading revenues were subsiding equity delivery investors.</p><p>With the new circular, we will, in all likelihood, have to let go of the zero brokerage structure and/or increase brokerage for F&O trades. Brokers across the industry will also have to tweak their pricing.</p><p>Check out <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/business-updates/sebis-true-to-label-circular>this post for more</a>.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1808105283828216127 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
