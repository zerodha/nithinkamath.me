By the way, this data only covers until 2019, and things have only gotten worse in the last five years.</p><p>Maybe a property price discount for the quality of air and water is the solution. If economics accounted for this, maybe we would all figure this out. Essentially the air and water quality determines the rate for the property.</p><p>Also, this would probably turn a property owner into the owner of the place, and better odds of fixing it if working as a group. For example, if I went from owning a property in JP Nagar and caring for it to caring for my layout in JP Nagar and then the whole of JP Nagar, it could have a better outcome.</p><p>While Delhi is getting all the attention, the AQI (Air quality index) isn&rsquo;t good in most urban areas in the country. Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and others are included in areas with very poor air quality.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1860578718080741626 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/health>health</a></li><li><a href=/tags/climate>climate</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
