Here is some data: Out of the ~65lk customers who traded with us last year, we have ~100 complaints of fraud. ~ 80 where login details were shared willingly & ~20 where email was hacked (all Rediffmail IDs).</p><p>As a % of such cases or even normal complaints to overall active customers, we are among the lowest in the broking industry. So this isn&rsquo;t just about us; regardless of the broker, you need to be careful not to share your login details & use a secure email.</p><p>Since all email hacking cases happen to use Rediffmail, it must have some vulnerability being exploited. We blocked Rediff IDs on trading accounts a while ago & have constantly been notifying users. We also now don&rsquo;t send password resets to Rediff email IDs.</p><p>We are soon launching a tool that disallows trades in illiquid options far away from theoretical price + a Kill Switch option to block orders in all penny stocks similar to F&O. Address the root cause of most hacking attempts.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1554370188447219712 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
