While it looks colourful, it has to be one of the world&rsquo;s worst invasive species. It was brought to India as an ornamental shrub in the 18th century, but it has now spread like a disease across 13 million hectares of priceless forest land and pastures.</p><p>The worst part is that this plant releases chemicals that harm the growth of native plant species. It&rsquo;s also toxic, so cows, goats, etc., can&rsquo;t eat it. The problem has become so bad that in the Nilgiris, it&rsquo;s become impossible to get rid of this plant.</p><p>There&rsquo;s some hope with organizations like Atree and the Shola Trust (both supported by <a href=https://x.com/RainmatterOrg>RainmatterOrg</a>) working on turning this harmful shrub into furniture and biomass.</p><p>Perhaps the most iconic transformation of the plant is the Lantana elephant, which you might have seen at the airports.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a video by <a href=https://x.com/thebetterindia>@thebetterindia</a> on how this plant spread in India and its side effects.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1833100655998677348 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/environment>environment</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
