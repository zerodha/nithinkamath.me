Through capital gains, it’s just 14.95% (with cess).</p><p>Why does this matter? Here’s what you should know if you invest in IPOs.</p><p>If you’re an investor (especially a VC), the math is simple: reduce corporate tax by showing minimal profits or losses. Spend (Burn) on acquiring users, build a growth narrative, and then sell shares at a higher valuation while paying much lower tax.</p><p>This spending also makes it harder for competitors to survive. To be clear, we’re not discussing R&D spending here, which, incidentally, is very low in India (0.7% of GDP).</p><p>What’s often overlooked is that VCs are essentially playing a tax arbitrage game. Look at most VC-backed businesses listed in the last few years, the reason they show little or no profit is partly due to this. Once you run a business this way, it’s extremely difficult to switch.</p><p>Every startup that’s 7-8 years old from the time of raising the first round faces constant pressure from VCs for an exit. With almost no M&A opportunities in India, IPO is often the only way out.</p><p>The government probably designed this tax arbitrage to incentivize companies to spend money and not just accumulate and distribute. But I’m unsure if the balance is correct. I think it’s also creating businesses that aren’t very resilient. One prolonged market downturn, and many of these unprofitable companies would struggle to survive.</p><p>Two things that make this more interesting:</p><p>Unprofitable growth gets valued at much higher multiples than steady profits. A company doing ₹100 cr revenue with 100% growth might get 10-15x, while a profitable one with 20% growth gets 3-5x. So VCs aren’t just saving on tax; they’re in essence creating a 3x higher exit valuation.</p><p>If you’re competing against someone burning cash, you almost have to match it to defend market share, even if you don’t want to, because of the quirks I mentioned above.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1985316723533435191 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/taxation>taxation</a></li><li><a href=/tags/startups>startups</a></li><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li><li><a href=/tags/investing>investing</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
