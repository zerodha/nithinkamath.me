But I think B2C startups globally that have IPO&rsquo;d in the last few years have ignored one of their biggest assetsâ€”an opportunity to turn millions of retail shareholders with influence on social media into brand ambassadors.</p><p>From the time a founder raises money from VCs and PE, they are primed to think about maximizing valuations. This means building a narrative that can price in the best-case outcome for the business. But what&rsquo;s needed to do well as a listed business is different.</p><p>To do well is to create wealth with the least volatility. Sharp falls tend to spook retail investors; they panic and exit at lows.
So, slow compounding for the long term, not max valuation in the short term. That means underselling and overdelivering, not the other way around.</p><p>Setting right expectations, being transparent, & not overselling are great ways to reduce the volatility of the stock price pre & post-IPO.</p><p>Doing this well can make shareholders feel like owners & help reduce customer acquisition costs, the biggest cost for B2C businesses.</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1610884429525966848 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/startups>startups</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
