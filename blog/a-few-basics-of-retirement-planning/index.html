In 20 years, retirement could be at 50 & life expectancy at 80. How do you fund the 30 years?</p><p>If climate change doesn&rsquo;t kill us all, retirement crisis will probably be the biggest problem for most countries 25 years from now. Earlier generations got lucky with long-term real estate & equity bull markets that helped create a retirement corpus. Unlikely in the future.</p><p>So,</p><ol><li><p>Stop getting triggered by everyone trying to lend & stop borrowing to buy things you don&rsquo;t need or depreciate in value.</p></li><li><p>Start saving early. Diversify across FDs/G-Secs & SIPs of Index funds/ETFs. Stocks are probably still the best bet to beat inflation long term.</p></li><li><p>Get a comprehensive health insurance policy for yourself & everyone in the family. One health incident is enough to push most people into financial ruin or set them back many years financially. Jobs don&rsquo;t last forever, hence one policy outside of what is provided at work.</p></li><li><p>If you have dependents, they should be covered if something happens to you. Buy a term policy with adequate cover. In the worst case, this money in a bank FD should cover their financial needs.</p></li></ol><p>But the biggest fix for most people is that they should stop taking loans!</p><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1586270855319130112 rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/investing>investing</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
