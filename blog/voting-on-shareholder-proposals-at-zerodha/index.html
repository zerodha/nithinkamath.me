One reason for this is, of course, retail investors are a small part of the Indian markets. The retail shareholding in NSE-listed companies is about ~7%.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also a lack of awareness among investors that they are entitled to vote on company resolutions. Just about 1-2 lakh retail investors voted on company resolutions in the past few years. The other issue is that most retail guys think that their vote doesn&rsquo;t make a difference. You could argue that this is one reason why minority shareholders have always been taken for granted historically.</p><p>So, in an effort to encourage more retail investors to vote, <a href=https://support.zerodha.com/category/console/profile/account/articles/cdsl-shareholder-evoting>we&rsquo;ve made the process simpler</a>. You can now vote on the resolution of the companies you have invested in, <a href=http://console.zerodha.com/account/demat>directly from Console</a>.</p><p>We had also recorded a brilliant podcast with Sivananth Ramachandran, the director of capital markets policy at CFA India, and Amit Tandon_in, the founder and managing director of IiAS on the rights of shareholders and corporate governance. <a href=https://tradingqna.com/t/an-investors-guide-to-shareholder-meetings-in-india/129207>Do listen</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/zerodhaonline/status/1509909992723578883?s=20&t=fU72J8jKh1bI7hS4XOhlMQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li><li><a href=/tags/markets>markets</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
