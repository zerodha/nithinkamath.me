We were quickly sold on their idea of getting users to invest in diversified baskets of stocks or ideas they understood vs single stocks, which reduced their risk.</p><p>We had just opened up Kite APIs. The idea was to enable startups to build platforms that could grow the shallow Indian capital market ecosystem.</p><p>Today, they&rsquo;ve built an amazing ecosystem of products. My favorites - <a href=https://gateway.smallcase.com>Broker Gateway</a> (donâ€™t know how they managed this), <a href=https://publisher.smallcase.com>Publisher for advisors</a>, and <a href=https://www.tickertape.in>Tickertapein</a>. We got them all together for the first time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MOJ54lBrFQ&t=821s">to talk about their journey on the Rainmatterin Podcast</a>.</p><p>Btw, Vasanth not my brother Kamath and the smallcase team helped us validate our idea of Broking as a service using Kite connect APIs. This is how <a href=https://rainmatter.com>Rainmatterin</a> came into existence.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1419653631725371398?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter>rainmatter</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
