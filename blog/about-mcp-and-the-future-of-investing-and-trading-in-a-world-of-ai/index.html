It feels to me like we&rsquo;re at the very beginning of a massive shift in how financial services will work.</p><p>At some point, I think all of it, from investing and trading to banking and payments, will happen through custom AI-powered apps built by users themselves using natural language instructions.</p><p>In that world, what&rsquo;s the role of a broker? Likely, we&rsquo;ll just be a set of &ldquo;pipes&rdquo; connecting users to exchanges and back-office systems. The interfaces will mostly be built by users themselves. The only way to stay relevant is to ensure we&rsquo;re the best pipe: fast, efficient, reliable, and invisible when it matters.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why, over the years, K and the tech team have been obsessively making our systems faster, more scalable, and future-ready. Even if these improvements don&rsquo;t immediately change a customer&rsquo;s trading or reporting experience, we&rsquo;ve chosen to fix every possible bottleneck today, not later.</p><p>Tools like ChatGPT and Claude make it clear this shift isn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;if&rdquo; but a &ldquo;when.&rdquo; It might take a few years or a decade, but it&rsquo;s inevitable. Human advisors will still have a role, mainly to help people stick to what these tools recommend.</p><p>As for how things will evolve, the answer is grey. No one knows. Our approach: stay curious, keep track of the trends, and act where it makes sense. For example, we&rsquo;ve intentionally held back on enabling AI-driven order placement.</p><p>In a future where everything is automated, trust and infrastructure will be our only real moats.</p><p>You can <a href=https://tradingqna.com/t/zerodha-s-claude-ai-portfolio-advisor/184000/3>post any queries here</a>.</p><p>Image: <a href=https://x.com/LiveMint>@LiveMint</a>.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1942223536552378499 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li><li><a href=/tags/technology>technology</a></li><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
