In that journey, we&rsquo;re super delighted to join <a href=https://twitter.com/madhuchandansc>Madhu Chandan</a> & <a href=https://www.organicmandya.com>Organic Mandya</a> on their mission to change farming & improve lives of farmers.</p><p>Organic Mandya <a href=https://grove.rainmatter.org/t/announcement-rainmatter-invests-in-organic-mandya/633>has helped create kitchen gardens</a> with fruit tree saplings in 5,000+ homes. Through Sunday Santhes in Mandya, they&rsquo;re creating direct farmer to consumer relationships.</p><p>They are also providing free training at Organic Mandya farms to 500-600 people a month to help them create livelihoods from small farms using organic farming methods.</p><p>There&rsquo;s an interesting backstory here too. On the same day, we first met Madhu we also got an email from Kunal Shah saying the $200k we had invested in CRED, irst round was now worth 20 timesRocket asking if we wanted any exit.</p><p>Not that we had to sell stake (partially) in CRED to invest in OM. But this was a good opportunity to put it out there that even if a fraction of love that goes to startups went towards social enterprises solving real-life problems, we can have more inclusive growth in India.</p><p>The quick returns on CRED were quite crazy, felt unreal like CRED Coins. I even jokingly mentioned to Kunal that us investing in Organic Mandya is probably the best use of CRED Coins so far.</p><p>You&rsquo;d be surprised at how much impact a small group of dedicated people and patient capital focused on solving real-life problems can have to create inclusive growth in India.</p><p>Like us, <a href=https://twitter.com/zenx>Sameer</a> and others on Rainmatter foundation, if you like what the folks at Organic Mandya are doing and want to make a difference in your own little way, check out their <a href=https://www.organicmandya.com/sweat-donation>Sweat Donation program</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1433820768597516291?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter-foundation>rainmatter foundation</a></li><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter>rainmatter</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
