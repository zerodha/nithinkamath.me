Despite the subsidies, only about 10% of urban households have rooftop solar. That means many people are conscious about being sustainable but can&rsquo;t do anything. <a href=https://www.sundaygrids.com/>SundayGrids</a> is taking an interesting approach to solve this problem. They setup solar power plants in other locations and allow people to reserve a part of the capacity in the plant. This generates credits, which can be used to reduce the power bill, even though the plant is in a different place. They are now live across India.</p><p>Various governments are now coming up with regulations to encourage third-party solar models. I think this is a cool way to make solar accessible to the masses.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve invested in <a href=https://www.sundaygrids.com/>SundayGrids</a> through <a href=https://rainmatter.com/>Rainmatterin</a>. Here&rsquo;s the founder talking about <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/rainmatter/sundaygrids-putting-solar-in-the-cloud>why they started and how the model works</a>.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/1830554127056683225 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter>rainmatter</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
