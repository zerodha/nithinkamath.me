I wasn&rsquo;t aware of this when I planted Conocarpus trees at home almost 10 years ago. No birds or animals have ever come to the tree.</p><p>I also realised much later that these trees aren&rsquo;t good for humans either. They cause allergic reactions in many people. It&rsquo;s been so many years now that I feel bad about cutting them down, but maybe I should.</p><p>So yeah, using native trees is super important. Next time you see someone planting eucalyptus, conocarpus, or similar non-native species, make sure to stop them.</p><p>By the way, NCF and ERA (a <a href=https://rainmatter.org/>Rainmatter Foundation</a> partner) are part of a group that developed a <a href=https://plantwise-india.org/#/tool>tool called Plantwise-India</a> to help people choose native plants when planting. You can provide your latitude and longitude, and it&rsquo;ll suggest options based on your location.</p><p>Currently, it only operates in the Western Ghats, one of the world&rsquo;s most significant biodiversity hotspots, but I hope it expands to other regions. It would be great if people everywhere could check what&rsquo;s actually native to their area before planting anything.</p><p>Check out the tool <a href=https://plantwise-india.org/#/tool>here</a>.</p><p><a href=https://x.com/Nithin0dha/status/2002315784706793532 rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/enviorment>enviorment</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
