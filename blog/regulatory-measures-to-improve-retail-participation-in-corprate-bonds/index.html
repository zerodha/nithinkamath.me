But SEBI has just made some important changes recently.</p><p>There were two big issues:</p><ol><li><p>Availability of bonds with small face values. Most bonds are issued through private placements and have face values of Rs 10lakh+. So retail investors were priced out.</p></li><li><p>All bond deals had to be settled through the clearing corporations, and they only accepted RTGS as a payment mode. So the minimum transaction size became Rs 2 lakh + by default.</p></li></ol><p>In the last few months, SEBI has made some key changes that make it easy for retail investors to invest in corporate bonds</p><ol><li><p>The face value of privately placed bonds was reduced to Rs 1 lakh.</p></li><li><p>Brokers are now allowed to participate on Request For Quote Platform (RFQ) on behalf of investors</p></li><li><p>The most important change from yesterday was allowing alternate payment modes apart from RTGS.
Now, bonds &lt; than 1 lakh can also be settled through clearing corporations.</p></li></ol><p>These measures will go a long way toward making it easier for retail investors to invest in corporate bonds. As retail demand increases, we should hopefully see more bond issues with smaller face values.
