But since 2010, volatility wise, we&rsquo;ve been much better compared to the US. While the credit is usually given to more local participation, it has got more to do with SEBI regulations that reduced leverage.</p><p>Btw the above chart isn&rsquo;t even a fair comparison, Nifty is an index of the 50 largest Indian companies & S&P 500 consists of the 500 largest US companies in the US. Nifty should be a lot more volatile.</p><p>The post-2008 crash regulatory changes I think led to this 👇</p><p>Aug 2011: Penalty for non-collection of end-of-day margins (SPAN) in F&O. Until then, brokers could allow customers to trade with whatever margins, even overnight</p><p>Aug 2014: Min 50% haircut for loan against security. Until then, promoters & HNIs could borrow as much as 100%</p><p>Unwinding of LAS positions when markets fell in 2008 created snowball effect. 50% is now high margin of safety for NBFCs, enough to avoid liquidation on bad days</p><p>May 2018: Penalty for non-collection of exposure & other margins in addition to SPAN for end-of-day F&O positions.</p><p>Nov 2019: Penalty for non-collection of end-of-day VAR+ELM margins for stocks. Until then, brokers could potentially fund the margins to buy stocks.</p><p>July 2020: Peak margin penalty for allowing customers any additional intraday leverage above SPAN+Exposure or VAR+ELM.</p><p>Most of these developments have hurt the revenues of brokers in the short term but led to lesser volatility. This has significantly improved the odds of retail participants doing well.
