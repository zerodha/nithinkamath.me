Most traders don&rsquo;t track reasons for taking trades & their track record since it has to be done manually. Now you can on Kite web & soon on mobile.</p><p>Tags have been <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/console/tagging-on-console-trading-journal-tracking-goals>on Console</a> since last year for creating goals on holdings & tracking P&L (trading journal). But trades & holdings could be tagged only by the next day, which meant many missed doing it. Now it can be done while placing an order.</p><p>So you can tag an order to either a goal or the reason for placing the order. All tags get imported to Console by 8 AM next day, and you can then filter holdings & P&L by tags. If you miss tagging while placing an order, you can always do it on Console the next trading day.</p><p>The next & more complex plan is to show P&L for tags when an order is being tagged & nudge customers away from taking trades for reasons that haven&rsquo;t worked in the past.Tags on Kite are in beta; if you have any feedback or spot issues, <a href=https://tradingqna.com/t/tags-on-kite-web-beta-trading-journal-tracking-goals/139284>post them here.</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1593473010492932096?s=20&t=J9PNVrbOty5gMoQy7Lgwyw" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/zerodha>zerodha</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
