This ‚Äúnothing will happen to me‚Äù attitude is common, especially among those under 50. But the truth is, strokes are rising sharply, up to nearly 30% of all strokes in the last few years, among 30 to 50-year-olds.</description></item><item><title>AMA with Zerodha's core team</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/ama-with-zerodhas-core-team/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/ama-with-zerodhas-core-team/</guid><description>A bunch of you asked us questions about our revenues, regulations, international investing, AI, and more. Nikhil, Kailash, Karthik Rangappa, Venu, and I answered a lot of those questions in this AMA.
Since there were several questions about US investing: we didn&amp;rsquo;t offer it until now because the regulations were unclear, but now there&amp;rsquo;s clarity. In May, SEBI and IFSCA allowed brokers to operate in GIFT City, and in June, the exchanges allowed brokers to offer third-party products.</description></item><item><title>Indian VC ecosystem has changed quite a bit in 15 years</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indian-vc-ecosystem-has-changed-quite-a-bit-in-15-years/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indian-vc-ecosystem-has-changed-quite-a-bit-in-15-years/</guid><description>The Indian VC ecosystem has changed quite a bit in 15 years. When we started Zerodha in 2010, &amp;ldquo;VC&amp;rdquo; was an exotic term, and there was barely any startup activity. The most popular VCs were dads, uncles and aunts.
Starting around 2010, we began seeing interest driven by India&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;opportunity size.&amp;rdquo; India&amp;rsquo;s population has done more to attract VC money than anything else üòõ &amp;ldquo;India has 120 crore people, and even if 1% buy X&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>1929 by Andrew Ross Sorkin is a must-read for anyone in the markets</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/1929-by-andrew-ross-sorkin-is-a-must-read-for-anyone-in-the-markets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/1929-by-andrew-ross-sorkin-is-a-must-read-for-anyone-in-the-markets/</guid><description>1929 by Andrew Ross Sorkin is a must-read for anyone in the markets‚Äîstocks, commodities, or crypto.
He quotes US President Hoover (1929):
‚ÄúThe only problem with capitalism is capitalists. They‚Äôre too damn greedy.‚Äù
Every crash, 1907, 1929, 1987, 2001 (Dotcom), 2008 (GFC), and so many more, follows the same script.
Greed drives markets higher, inflating bubbles that draw in even those who don‚Äôt understand the risks. As euphoria builds, leverage accumulates quietly somewhere in the system: loans, margins, complex derivatives.</description></item><item><title>One year of the Zerodha FLOSS fund</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/one-year-of-the-zerodha-floss-fund/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/one-year-of-the-zerodha-floss-fund/</guid><description>We started FLOSS/fund in 2024 to give up to $1 million annually to support the development of FOSS (free and open-source) projects globally.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what K said in a post reflecting on the past year, making the case for the Indian government also to fund FOSS for strategic tech sovereignty:
&amp;ldquo;Actually, no amount of material resources can enable governments to develop, nurture, and sustain complex, high-quality FOSS projects themselves in the way a community of passionate maintainers can.</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity is as human as it is technical</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/cybersecurity-is-as-human-as-it-is-technical/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/cybersecurity-is-as-human-as-it-is-technical/</guid><description>So, my personal Twitter account was compromised yesterday because I fell for a phishing e-mail early in the morning while at home when browsing on my personal device.
A momentary lapse in attention. The e-mail got through all spam and phishing filters. I clicked on the &amp;lsquo;Change Your Password&amp;rsquo; link and entered the password.

Free and open-source software (FOSS) enables just that‚Äîtech sovereignty and, at the same time, mutually assured global collaboration and innovation. IndiaAI Mission&amp;rsquo;s recent push for sovereign open-source LLMs is a great example for this. Without FOSS, there would be no Zerodha or the global digital ecosystem as we know it today.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an article by K (Kailash) on the topic from 2021 that&amp;rsquo;s still relevant now.</description></item><item><title>Financial inclusion needs more than just digital access</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/financial-inclusion-needs-more-than-just-digital-access/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/financial-inclusion-needs-more-than-just-digital-access/</guid><description>The entire Indian financial services industry, including Zerodha, has been a massive beneficiary of the ease of digital onboarding via Aadhaar e-Sign, eKYC, etc. It has been a big reason for the increase in financial inclusion among Tier 2 and 3 cities and rural parts of the country; people who had not previously interacted with the formal financial system.
While many of us take the benefits of these digital systems for granted, being in a city like Bengaluru (and a position of privilege), I was surprised by the extent of challenges with OTP verification and the physical/biometric side of these systems until I read articles like these in The Times of India and elsewhere.</description></item><item><title>Real stories from parents investing through Zerodha minor accounts.</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/real-stories-from-parents-investing-through-zerodha-minor-accounts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/real-stories-from-parents-investing-through-zerodha-minor-accounts/</guid><description>I can keep giving gyan about starting to invest early for your kids, but nothing beats hearing it from parents who are actually doing it.

Hopefully, this makes loan against securities (LAS) more popular.
It‚Äôs ridiculous how many people holding stocks continue taking personal loans or using credit cards at much higher rates‚Äîcredit cards can go up to 40%+. Even at Zerodha Capital, we see this constantly. People just aren‚Äôt aware they can replace high-interest debt with LAS, which is one reason our book is still only ‚Çπ450 crores.</description></item><item><title>Why short-term growth is the wrong metric</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-short-term-growth-is-the-wrong-metric/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-short-term-growth-is-the-wrong-metric/</guid><description>On the question of what would we do if weekly options were removed, I suppose we&amp;rsquo;ll see another hit to our revenues in the short-term.
Having said that, when you&amp;rsquo;re building a business for the long term, focusing on quarterly or even annual growth is a poor metric. The more you focus on them, the higher the odds that you&amp;rsquo;ll do things that are bad for your customers.</description></item><item><title>15 years of Zerodha</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/15-years-of-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/15-years-of-zerodha/</guid><description>From 2021, I had been tweeting about the risks to the broking business, but somehow I kept getting surprised on the upside. But starting around October last year, all the risks I was thinking about crystallised. First came the STT increase on options, then the removal of exchange transaction charge rebates, and a reduction in weekly expiries. In addition to this, there was a significant decline in market activity. Due to all these factors, our revenues and profits suffered a decline.</description></item><item><title>Zerodha Fund House crosses ‚Çπ8000 crores AUM</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodha-fund-house-crosses-8000-crores-aum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/zerodha-fund-house-crosses-8000-crores-aum/</guid><description>Zerodha Fund House is almost 2 years old, and we have reached ~‚Çπ8,000 crores despite not talking much about it. What&amp;rsquo;s cool is that practically all of this AUM comes from individual investors.
The AMC has grown steadily even as competition has intensified, with newer AMCs entering the market and existing AMCs launching more passive funds. We could have grown our AUM faster by offering regular plans and paying commissions, but we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to remain direct-only and focus on easy-to-understand index funds and ETFs like our recently launched multi-asset fund (link in the replies).</description></item><item><title>Ditto rebuilding trust in insurance</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/ditto-rebuilding-trust-in-insurance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/ditto-rebuilding-trust-in-insurance/</guid><description>Historically, people haven&amp;rsquo;t bought life and health insurance because of all the scams and spam.

It determines how well soil holds water, delivers nutrients to plants, maintains structure, and supports the millions of microbes that make soil alive. When SOC drops below 0.5%, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at desert-like conditions where nothing grows without the farmer pumping in fertilisers. India&amp;rsquo;s farmland averages a shocking 0.3% SOC. Compare that to European Union cropland at 1.8%‚Äîthat&amp;rsquo;s the gold standard.
A few weeks ago, Shashi Kumar, the founder of Akshayakalpa, shared something incredible from AK Farms.</description></item><item><title>What does Zerodha do differently?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/what-does-zerodha-do-differently/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/what-does-zerodha-do-differently/</guid><description>Someone on Reddit asked what does Zerodha do differently, how are we profitable, why don&amp;rsquo;t IPO etc. This is what I replied:
Hmmm&amp;hellip; so you forget that we have spent 15 years getting here. And maybe another 10 years, before Zerodha, I was involved in the markets in some form. So, 25 years in all.

Having said that, I would not be surprised if they were banned completely, and/or if there is some product suitability framework that makes it harder for people to trade F&amp;amp;O.
By the way, as I&amp;rsquo;ve said numerous times before, regulatory risk is by far the biggest risk for brokers like us.</description></item><item><title>Insights from our interaction with Social Alpha</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/insights-from-our-interaction-with-social-alpha/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/insights-from-our-interaction-with-social-alpha/</guid><description>We at Rainmatter finally met the Social Alpha team, and I am still thinking about everything Manoj Malgharia shared.
