I know many who&amp;rsquo;ve lost quickly. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a plan to manage risk and size your bets, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to keep the money you make.
Here are a few wonderful tips from a couple of Tom Basso&amp;rsquo;s recent podcasts:

We rely on it heavily to power everything from our products to Z-connect, Tradingqna, and even my laptop (which runs Zorin Linux). Without FOSS, Zerodha wouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist and neither would the larger startup ecosystem.
We have always supported the open source ecosystem in numerous ways and are now formalizing all those efforts by setting up a fund to support FOSS projects globally, starting with $1 million a year.</description></item><item><title>Money mistakes are the best form of financial literacy</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/money-mistakes-are-best-form-of-financial-literacy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/money-mistakes-are-best-form-of-financial-literacy/</guid><description>One good thing about all the post-pandemic excess in the stock market is that the Indian stock market has become a lot younger.
Of course, many of these young investors are doing a lot of things they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing. But they are better off making all the mistakes when they are young and have very little to lose, than later in life when they have more money and responsibilities.</description></item><item><title>How SEBI puts consumer interest first</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/how-sebi-puts-consumer-interest-first/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/how-sebi-puts-consumer-interest-first/</guid><description>One challenge in today&amp;rsquo;s media-saturated environment for brokers like us and also regulators is the sheer noise because even small things can be blown out of proportion.
Having said that, I am part of various committees, and what has always amazed me is the consultative approach that SEBI has taken over the years. No regulation is passed without hearing from the industry and other experts. This shows in the fact that today, our capital markets are among the safest in the world, if not the safest.</description></item><item><title>Update on all our educational content initiatives</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/update-on-all-our-educational-content-initiatives/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/update-on-all-our-educational-content-initiatives/</guid><description>Some people, jokingly perhaps, say, &amp;ldquo;Zerodha is a content company.&amp;rdquo; But this isn&amp;rsquo;t something we are doing now.

Starting from October 14th, shares bought will be directly credited to the customer&amp;rsquo;s Demat account through net settlement. This significantly simplifies our DP process, which today involves receiving shares for the entire group of clients and then allocating them based on purchases made, i.e., gross settlement.
And this is much safer, too.</description></item><item><title>Impact of SEBI's on new rules for index derivatives</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-sebis-cirular-on-new-rules-for-index-derivatives/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/impact-of-sebis-cirular-on-new-rules-for-index-derivatives/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the potential impact of only one weekly expiry of index derivatives per exchange and contract sizes going up by around 2.5 times.
As things stand, assuming that those trading weekly don&amp;rsquo;t move on to trading monthly, the impact will be ~60% of overall F&amp;amp;O trades and ~30% of our overall orders.
I guess things will become much clearer from November 20th.

OctaFX, and most other CFD platforms, are the counterparty to every trade you take on them.
Essentially, the platform makes money only when you lose. And trading with extreme leverage of 100 to 500 times your capital is a sure way to lose money.
I had written about CFDs sometime back. We recently spoke about this in The Daily Brief by Markets by Zerodha as well.</description></item><item><title>Alert Triggers Order feature on Kite</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/alert-triggers-order-feature-on-kite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/alert-triggers-order-feature-on-kite/</guid><description>Alert triggers an order (ATO) was on our to-do list for a long time, and we just launched it on Kite web.

This happens when banks in Maharashtra are closed, but trading on exchanges is open.

One large chocolate milkshake has 1000+ calories, or 40% of an average person&amp;rsquo;s calorie intake, which is about 2500 calories.
But showing that a food contains 40% of the total calories that a person consumes in a day might reduce the sales of a lot of things.</description></item><item><title>NSE circular suspending referral programmes</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/nse-circular-suspending-referral-programmes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/nse-circular-suspending-referral-programmes/</guid><description>NSE issued a circular last week stopping brokers from sharing any brokerage as a referral incentive unless that person is registered as an authorized person with the exchanges.

I&amp;rsquo;m guessing most ULIPs are sold by banks because of the high commissions on these products.
While ULIPs promise the best of both worlds, that is, both investments and insurance, the reality is that they offer the worst of both worlds. They have high commissions, and most importantly, the insurance cover you get is not enough.
You are better off separating insurance and investments by investing in direct mutual funds and buying a term insurance policy.</description></item><item><title>India needs more IPOs doing well</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-needs-more-ipos-doing-well/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/india-needs-more-ipos-doing-well/</guid><description>Congrats to Ola Electric, Unicommerce, and First Cry on the listing.

If our markets have to grow, we need more homegrown companies to list and also leave something on the table for IPO investors.
IPOs doing well are good because they incentivize more companies to consider an IPO, and attract more retail and institutional investors.
We also need more IPOs because, as Ananth Narayan, the WTM at SEBI, recently pointed out, we seem to have a problem with the supply of new securities.</description></item><item><title>Daily brief podcast</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/daily-brief-podcast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/daily-brief-podcast/</guid><description>A personal problem I had was that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a short ~15 minute podcast that covered the top 3–5 markets and business stories in a given day.

The suggested changes, even with the STT increase, won’t really change options volumes. But on the flipside, they will reduce futures volumes.
From what I’ve seen at Zerodha, futures traders have higher odds of making money than option buyers. On a gross basis, futures traders are profitable about 50% of the time as opposed to options traders, who are only profitable about 10% of the time.</description></item><item><title>Reports for tax filing at Zerodha</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/reports-for-tax-filing-at-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/reports-for-tax-filing-at-zerodha/</guid><description>The last date for filing taxes is July 31, 2024.

This circular has a significant impact on brokers, traders, and investors.
Stock exchanges charge transaction fees based on the overall turnover contributed by brokers. The difference between what the brokers charge the customer and what the exchange charges the broker at the end of the month is a rebate, which goes to brokers.</description></item><item><title>Rise in options trading and the regulatory risks</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rise-in-options-trading-and-the-regulatory-risks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/rise-in-options-trading-and-the-regulatory-risks/</guid><description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve said before, regulatory risk is the biggest risk for any regulated business.
We are in the middle of a period of excess in options trading. Volumes in index options have gone up from 4.6 lk cr in 2018 to 138 lk cr in 2024, and, more importantly, the share of retail has gone up from 2% to 41%.
We have been a big beneficiary of this jump in volume but have always been aware that it can be significantly reduced in size due to regulations, which can significantly hurt revenues, and that&amp;rsquo;s also why we have never made any forward projections.</description></item><item><title>Your simple guide to IndiaDataHub’s economic data</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/your-simple-guide-to-indiadatahubs-economic-data/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/your-simple-guide-to-indiadatahubs-economic-data/</guid><description>The expectation was that we would have a better-than-average monsoon this year.

Since the time leverage restrictions were introduced, intraday equity volumes have stagnated, despite the mother of all bull runs. Apart from leverage, the fact that securities Transaction Tax (STT) is higher for intraday equity and futures compared to options has also hurt the volumes. The hope is STT on intraday equity and futures will reduce some day. 😬
Intraday equity trading turnover is important because it significantly reduces the impact cost for those making equity delivery trades.</description></item><item><title>Introducing notes feature on Kite Web</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-notes-feature-on-kite-web/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-notes-feature-on-kite-web/</guid><description>Have you checked out the notes feature on Kite Web?

Starting in 2020, the share of corporates, foreign investors, and DIIs in option turnover dropped from about 30% to 9.9%.

So, transferring any property yielding rental income to the HUF, opening a Demat account in the HUF name, transferring money to the HUF bank account, accepting gifts, etc.</description></item><item><title>Varsity junior videos from Tungi</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/varsity-junior-videos-from-tungi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/varsity-junior-videos-from-tungi/</guid><description>Someone sent me this heartwarming video of kids watching Varsity Junior videos from Tungi, a small village in Bihar with just about 6,000 people 😀</description></item><item><title>Startup Mahakumbh</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/startup-mahakumbh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/startup-mahakumbh/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s great to see the Indian startup ecosystem go from strength to strength.

But most traders ignore this and end up with notices.
March 15th is the deadline for filing advanced taxes, and many traders think that it may be applicable to them. If you have an estimated tax liability of Rs 10,000 in the form of capital gains, then you have to pay advance taxes.
Profits from F&amp;amp;O and intraday are considered business income, and you will have to estimate their profits for the entire financial year and pay the applicable advance taxes as per the four installments.</description></item><item><title>Rrvamped Z-Connect blog</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/revamped-z-connect-blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/revamped-z-connect-blog/</guid><description>We recently redesigned Z-Connect, our blog that was started in 2012. It reminded me of how and why we started it. When we started Zerodha, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to spend money on advertising. So, we figured that sharing everything we knew about trading, investing, and the capital markets openly was a better way to reach new customers.
At that point, it was probably one of a handful of finance blogs.

One big reason is a lack of awareness about insurance, rampant misselling complexity, spam, etc.
Health insurance and life insurance (term insurance) are the only two products most people need. But the products that are sold the most are ULIPs and other traditional products that promise both insurance and investments but offer the worst of both worlds, not to mention the ridiculous commissions.</description></item><item><title>Growing locally with India</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/growing-locally-within-india/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/growing-locally-within-india/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve said this earlier: for India to grow inclusively, wealth has to be created locally. Today, much of the success of homegrown startups goes to investors outside India.
Staying in India and incorporating at home also saves the future hassle of paying huge taxes to flip back. Also, the growing local pools of capital, ever-improving regulations, and the growth of IPO markets have made India a much more attractive destination than it ever was.</description></item><item><title>From loan apps to phishing websites, more scams</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/from-loan-apps-to-phishing-websites-more-scams/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/from-loan-apps-to-phishing-websites-more-scams/</guid><description>After the Chinese loan apps scam, the latest scam from actors in China and other Asian countries is phishing websites.

This makes it easier for you to track your returns, and there are no hassles with fractional units and figuring out your taxes.</description></item><item><title>A few thoughts on this National Startup Day</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-this-national-startup-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/a-few-thoughts-on-this-national-startup-day/</guid><description>Today is National Startup Day, which was started in 2016 to highlight the contribution of startups to India&amp;rsquo;s economic growth.

I think for the majority of our country, i.e. beyond the top 5 to 10% of the country yet to start investing, equities may not be the right instruments because they can be scary because of the volatility.

He tells our customer that if he transfers Rs 1.8 lakh as a registration fee, he will get back Rs 5 crore.</description></item><item><title>Indian fascination with America and it's investment potential</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indian-fascination-with-america-and-its-investment-potential/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/indian-fascination-with-america-and-its-investment-potential/</guid><description>Most Americans I know with money want to invest in India because they believe they are plateauing as a nation and that we are the future. But somehow, young Indians are still bitten by the bug to travel to America to build their future. This is such a dichotomy.

Whether you are a broker, a bank, or any entity that directly settles with end customers, once securities or funds are sent to the wrong person, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get them back. This risk is like a hanging sword for these businesses.</description></item><item><title>Simplifying NRI investments at Zerodha</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/simplifying-nri-investments-at-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/simplifying-nri-investments-at-zerodha/</guid><description>NRI account opening reminds me of how retail broking worked before it became digital, thanks to Aadhaar, e-Sign, and Digilocker.

Many NRIs want to invest in India but don&amp;rsquo;t because of the onerous account opening process and the added notarizing &amp;amp; international courier costs.
To open an NRI account, you must fill out physical forms and notarize the documents by visiting banks or embassies.</description></item><item><title>Beware of pig butchering scams</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/beware-of-pig-butchering-scams/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/beware-of-pig-butchering-scams/</guid><description>The scale of pig butchering scams in India runs into tens of thousands of crores. It is scary how many people fall for fake job offer scams, scammy high-return investment schemes and crypto investments, etc.
As the name implies, a pig butchering scam involves fattening the victim before butchering. Scammers gain the trust of users by using fake profiles. They use the pretense of love and friendship to gain the trust of users and then induce them to send money for jobs and high-return investments and steal the money.</description></item><item><title>Introducing open interest visualization on charts by Sensibull</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-open-interest-visualization-on-charts-by-sensibull/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-open-interest-visualization-on-charts-by-sensibull/</guid><description>Tracking the accumulation of open interest (OI) at different strikes can give you insight into market directions.

Most Indians are just one serious health incident away from financial ruin. But having insurance alone isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Just because you have insurance doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean all your claims will be processed. Insurance companies use numerous reasons to either not pay fully or flat-out reject the claims.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to know the common reasons why claims get rejected and what you can do about it.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Zerodha Fund House</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-zerodha-fund-house/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/introducing-zerodha-fund-house/</guid><description>So, the NFOs of the first two funds of Zerodha Fund House are finally open.

Indian startups will most likely continue to attract foreign capital even if all the news might make it seem otherwise. This is mainly because we are the fastest-growing country in the world, and investing is about selecting the best from all the existing options. It is a relative decision, and global investors have to invest.
By the way, anecdotally talking to some international investors, Indian startups seem to be faring better in the last year or so, where the focus has been more on reducing burn &amp;amp; getting on the path to profitability.</description></item><item><title>Companies should help employees become healthier</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/companies-should-help-employees-become-healthier/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/companies-should-help-employees-become-healthier/</guid><description>We came first in the corporate team category at the half at IRONMAN Triathlon in Goa today.

All of us on the core team have never thought of notional valuations right from the start because they can go up and down with market conditions.

Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. Due to overuse, germs have become resistant to antibiotics, leading to health complications and deaths.

This is because of liquidation preferences &amp;amp; the disconnect between valuations and business fundamentals.
A liquidation preference allows investors to recover their investment before anyone else. This is how all startups raise money. Nobody thinks of it as a loan, but it is similar. The more money founders raise, the harder it is for them and their teams to see equity upside.</description></item><item><title>The many benfits of hemp</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-many-benfits-of-hemp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-many-benfits-of-hemp/</guid><description>Hemp belongs to the Cannabis sativa family—the same as marijuana.

I&amp;rsquo;m unsure how it will affect the mental health of active retail F&amp;amp;O traders in the long term.

We had written about this issue on the Rainmatter blog that using exchange data feeds for gaming involving money is an issue, since regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow it.
When regulations aren&amp;rsquo;t explicit or clear, it&amp;rsquo;s always better to do things in a regulatorily appropriate way, or always better to assume that you are regulated and do things that regulators would expect.</description></item><item><title>The symbolism behind Goddess Lakshmi sitting on a lotus and Goddess Saraswati sitting on a stone</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/symbolism-behind-lakshmi-and-saraswati/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/symbolism-behind-lakshmi-and-saraswati/</guid><description>As we celebrate Laksmi Puja this Deepavali, here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting anecdote.

While some are for regulatory reasons, but mostly for conducive IPO markets here. For India to become wealthy inclusively, wealth creation from successful businesses has to happen at home.
If wealth created by leveraging Indian resources doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay back home, how will we ever be a $5 trillion economy &amp;amp; more?

Yield = ((Rent – interest - maintenance)/Total cost)%
If yield -ve, the price has to go up by at least 10% per yr to beat inflation, or the price has to double every ~7 years.
For the price of the property to double every 7 yrs, the rents also have to go up as much.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on real estate performance</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/thoughts-on-real-estate-performance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/thoughts-on-real-estate-performance/</guid><description>Being overexposed to real estate worked well for the current &amp;gt; 50-year-olds, as returns beat inflation+interest costs by a fair bit until the early 2010s.

At today&amp;rsquo;s prices, real estate is unlikely to beat inflation + interest costs in the long run.

Leverage is like WMD (Weapon of mass destruction), resulting in excesses both on the way up and down. When markets fall, long leveraged positions are required to bring additional margins, failing which positions are forced to exit resulting in the markets falling even more.</description></item><item><title>Government taxes on Crypto could have been blessing in disguise</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/government-taxes-on-crypto-could-have-been-blessing-in-disguise-for-indian-crypto-investors/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/government-taxes-on-crypto-could-have-been-blessing-in-disguise-for-indian-crypto-investors/</guid><description>I think many Indian crypto investors accidentally got lucky due to TDS &amp;amp; Tax on Crypto announcement this budget in Feb.

The order placed is mostly sent to a market maker—typically hedge funds, that will either be the counterparty to the trade or send them to the US exchanges.</description></item><item><title>Console portfolio visualization</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/console-portfolio-visualization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/console-portfolio-visualization/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re all searching for stocks that always go up.

Hopefully, this high court order will put an end to what feels like a regressive tax by big tech, especially on SMEs.
Years ago, when our competitors first ran ads against the &amp;ldquo;Zerodha&amp;rdquo; keyword, we got influenced to run ads as well. We stopped quickly when we realized that it made no difference to our traffic &amp;amp; the ad was essentially cannibalizing our organic traffic while costing us money.</description></item><item><title>Wrong estimates of trading activity, market size and market share</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/wrong-estimates-of-trading-activity-market-size-and-market-share/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/wrong-estimates-of-trading-activity-market-size-and-market-share/</guid><description>Even to this day, a lot of people misconstrue the turnover numbers declared by the exchanges. This often leads to wrong estimates of trading activity and market size &amp;amp; share. So if A buys stock X for Rs 1lk &amp;amp; B sells for Rs 1lk, the exchange turnover = Rs 1lk &amp;amp; not Rs 2lks.
To calculate market size estimates based on exchange turnovers, the right way would be to multiply the exchange turnover by 2 and then calculate the %.</description></item><item><title>The idea behind Rainmatter Foundation</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-idea-behind-rainmatter-foundation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-idea-behind-rainmatter-foundation/</guid><description>Rainmatter Foundation started with the question of what&amp;rsquo;s the point of all this success if we don&amp;rsquo;t have a planet to live on?

You can now use Iceberg orders on Kite to slice large orders into smaller legs that are executed only once the previous leg is, helping reduce impact costs.
Impact cost, or the money a trader loses in the bid-ask spreads, increases substantially with high volumes or overtrading.

For most naked option writers, the losses in a volatile month may equal profits made over a long time period.

Firstly, in the US, brokers can earn in ways that SEBI rightly doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow here: Payment for order flow: selling customer orders to HFT firms.

A 1% TDS means 1% of every trade value is blocked by the platform.</description></item><item><title>Tax arbitrage between dividends and selling a stake and startup profitability</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/tax-arbitrage-between-dividends-and-selling-stake/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/tax-arbitrage-between-dividends-and-selling-stake/</guid><description>Can the tax arbitrage that exists between earning through dividends(~52%) vs earning through selling a stake (~24%) be the reason why most new-age businesses are not profitable? I think so. Money is like a river, it flows where the conditions are conducive to its flow.
The Govt capping the surcharge on LTCG when investing in unlisted companies to encourage investments in startups in the budget is a welcome move. But maybe the tax arbitrage shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so large that everyone just focuses on valuations and not on profits &amp;amp; sustainability.</description></item><item><title>Unauthorised CFD and forex trading platforms</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/unauthorised-cfd-and-forex-trading-platforms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/unauthorised-cfd-and-forex-trading-platforms/</guid><description>We had cautioned people about illegal CFD &amp;amp; Forex &amp;amp; Binary trading platforms a while back, but I still keep seeing those ads, which means people still losing money.

That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s legal—it will only be after the crypto bill. Until then, regulated entities in India can&amp;rsquo;t offer trading in crypto. Here&amp;rsquo;s my reading of crypto post the budget.
The 30% tax without the option to set-off of losses against other tokens or deductions can lead to a drop in turnover. Market markers &amp;amp; active traders are usually 80%+ of turnover in most trading businesses.</description></item><item><title>From Native to React Native to Flutter</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/from-native-to-react-native-to-flutter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/from-native-to-react-native-to-flutter/</guid><description>A regular question that comes up is about our use of Flutter for building our mobile apps.

Lower txn costs improve liquidity, hence decrease impact costs.

Every algo like any trader, strategy or stock, has ups &amp;amp; downs.

Yes, when you buy options the max you can lose is the premium you have paid. But to get a sense of risk and how fast or easily you can lose, you should look at the exposure or contract value, not the premium.

Averaging down or buying more of an asset, be it stock or crypto, as the price keeps going down and hoping that the price bounces to recover losses or make profits faster. Common behaviour among retail investors.
While it is tempting to average down, the odds of this strategy working are significantly low in the long run.

With Crypto exchanges offering 10 to 100x leverage (futures), on days like today, I wonder who monitors liquidity position of these platforms.
In regulated space, even with all checks &amp;amp; balances, brokerage firms once in a while on days of extreme volatility go bust.

Large cities are choking &amp;amp; will continue to break down every time we&amp;rsquo;re tested, COVID today, could be water shortages, pollution, floods, etc.</description></item><item><title>Why FOSS?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-foss/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/why-foss/</guid><description>Every time we share a post on the Zerodha tech blog, we get a lot of love from the tech community, but also questions like - Why FOSS?

Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d shared this sometime back.
Unlike buying a mobile phone or ordering a pizza, you don&amp;rsquo;t invest in stocks &amp;amp; MFs impulsively. Most often than not, we invest because of greed or because of our friends. And regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to advertise greed.
Ads do help you create visibility and build credibility - two really important things in the business of money, especially the first few years.</description></item><item><title>Podcast with Prateek Singh, the founder of LearnApp</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/podcast-with-prateek-learnapp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/podcast-with-prateek-learnapp/</guid><description>From the start at Zerodha, we&amp;rsquo;ve constantly shared things to educate people about the capital markets.

Easier for employees of banks, brokerages, wealth management firms to mis-sell as relationships are already established &amp;amp; there is trust with the brand, which is why the customer has allowed them to be custodians of their assets.</description></item><item><title>How to know when odds are higher?</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/how-to-know-when-odds-are-higher/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/how-to-know-when-odds-are-higher/</guid><description>Got a few questions about this tweet.

We&amp;rsquo;ll see a drop in trading volumes and an increase in impact cost. But in the long term, more traders will survive &amp;amp; hopefully make up for the dip.
There is an argument to be made for lesser intraday margins. VAR+ELM or SPAN+Exposure margin calculation is based on risk/volatility. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between intraday &amp;amp; overnight risk, or that intraday is less risky and hence ideally requires lesser margins.</description></item><item><title>Trading with other people’s money</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-with-other-peoples-money/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/trading-with-other-peoples-money/</guid><description>Managing other people&amp;rsquo;s money in ways that aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed leads to the most complaints with the regulators.

Most trades are leveraged &amp;amp; ideally we should look at the margins being traded, not the trade value. Turnover this way will be less than 10% of the trading turnover declared.
The best way to estimate the size of the Indian capital markets is by checking the revenue pool.

Your instincts on what is right will work better when you build a business/career around what you love.</description></item><item><title>The real hockey stick growth worth chasing</title><link>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-real-hockey-stick-growth-worth-chasing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nithinkamath.me/blog/the-real-hockey-stick-growth-worth-chasing/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The real hockey curve growth we all need to be chasing - seeds (maybe not companies)&amp;quot;. @zenx said while handing over these 50 odd seeds.
